  {"id":"abascal_love_2015","abstract":"According to recent research, ethnoracial diversity negatively affects trust and social capital. This article challenges the current conception and measurement of “diversity” and invites scholars to rethink “social capital” in complex societies. It reproduces the analysis of Putnam and shows that the association between diversity and self-reported trust is a compositional artifact attributable to residential sorting: nonwhites report lower trust and are overrepresented in heterogeneous communities. The association between diversity and trust is better explained by differences between communities and their residents in terms of race/ethnicity, residential stability, and economic conditions; these classic indicators of inequality, not diversity, strongly and consistently predict self-reported trust. Diversity indexes also obscure the distinction between in-group and out-group contact. For whites, heterogeneity means more out-group neighbors; for nonwhites, heterogeneity means more in-group neighbors. Therefore, separate analyses were conducted by ethnoracial groups. Only for whites does living among out-group members—not in diverse communities per se—negatively predict trust.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Abascal","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Baldassarri","given":"Delia"}],"citation-key":"abascal_love_2015","container-title":"American Journal of Sociology","container-title-short":"American Journal of Sociology","DOI":"10/f7z88k","ISSN":"0002-9602","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,11,1]]},"page":"722-782","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"Love Thy Neighbor?

When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model).

  {"id":"alba_neighborhood_1995-1","abstract":"This article investigates the shifting racial and ethnic composition of neighborhoods in the Greater New York metropolitan region in the 1970-1990 period, during which the region has been one of the nation's major receiving grounds for new immigrant groups. Neighborhoods are defined in terms of census tracts, and changes in neighborhood composition are tracked with data from the 1970, 1980, and 1990 censuses. Four racial/ethnic groups are considered: non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics and Asians. The analysis, which exploits the neighborhood transition table (Denton and Massey, 1991), reveals a somewhat paradoxical set of developments. On the one hand, there is increasing racial and ethnic complexity in neighborhoods throughout the region: more and more neighborhoods contain multiple groups; fewer and fewer are ethnically or racially homogeneous. On the other hand, there is a crosscutting trend: all-minority neighborhoods, occupied by blacks or blacks and Hispanics, are growing in number. We demonstrate further that these two patterns are associated with other characteristics of neighborhoods, such as the median incomes of their households and whether they are located in cities or suburbs.","author":[{"family":"Alba","given":"Richard D."},{"family":"Denton","given":"Nancy A."},{"family":"Leung","given":"Shu-yin J."},{"family":"Logan","given":"John R."}],"citation-key":"alba_neighborhood_1995-1","container-title":"International Migration Review","container-title-short":"Int Migr Rev","DOI":"10/d2bx3n","ISSN":"0197-9183","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1995]]},"language":"en","page":"625-656","title":"Neighborhood Change under Conditions of Mass Immigration: The New York City Region, 1970--1990","title-short":"Neighborhood Change under Conditions of Mass Immigration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2547497","volume":"29"},

  {"id":"bader_community_2015","abstract":"Existing theories of racial residential segregation predicted more dramatic declines in segregation than we have seen in the past two decades. We argue that the failure to find the predicted declines is the result of failing to study the processes of residential search and the perceptions upon which those searches are based. These perceptions are a critical but often-ignored component of the residential sorting process that ultimately translates into persistent segregation, but also offers hope for future integration.  We examine where Chicago-area residents would “seriously consider” and “never consider” living and find that community attraction and avoidance are highly racialized. Additionally, we find that respondents would avoid a much higher number of communities, suggesting people attempt to limit choice sets when considering where they would move. Race is most influential for the perceptions of whites and least for that of blacks. Latinos perceptions are substantially influenced by correlated demographic characteristics.","author":[{"family":"Bader","given":"Michael D.

One reflection of this tolerance is the diminishing occurrence of White flight: in 2010, only one in one hundred neighborhoods is all-White. Although some have declared the \"end of segregation\" based on this news, I document how ``integrated'' neighborhoods are actually fragmented into many different types of racial change. This means that some nominally integrated neighborhoods have less in common with one another than they do with adjacent segregated neighborhoods. Others, however, appear to maintain stable integration across many decades. I consider the historical, geographic, and demographic factors that can help explain how neighborhoods end up following different trajectories. I argue that this fragmented integration should cause us to think more deeply about what integration means and make policies that address the foundation of spatial inequality in the post-Civil Rights Era.","author":[{"family":"Bader","given":"Michael D.

  {"id":"bell_silent_2005","abstract":"When the landmark Supreme Court case of Brown vs. Board of Education was handed down in 1954, many civil rights advocates believed that the decision, which declared public school segregation unconstitutional, would become the Holy Grail of racial justice. Fifty years later, despite its legal irrelevance and the racially separate and educationally ineffective state of public schooling for most black children, Brown is still viewed by many as the perfect precedent. Here, Derrick Bell shatters the shining image of this celebrated ruling. He notes that, despite the onerous burdens of segregation, many black schools functioned well and racial bigotry had not rendered blacks a damaged race. He maintains that, given what we now know about the pervasive nature of racism, the Court should have determined instead to rigorously enforce the \"equal\" component of the \"separate but equal\" standard. Racial policy, Bell maintains, is made through silent covenants--unspoken convergences of interest and involuntary sacrifices of rights--that ensure that policies conform to priorities set by policy-makers. Blacks and whites are the fortuitous winners or losers in these unspoken agreements. The experience with Brown, Bell urges, should teach us that meaningful progress in the quest for racial justice requires more than the assertion of harms. Strategies must recognize and utilize the interest-convergence factors that strongly influence racial policy decisions.In Silent Covenants, Bell condenses more than four decades of thought and action into a powerful and eye-opening book.","author":[{"family":"Bell","given":"Derrick"}],"citation-key":"bell_silent_2005","event-place":"Oxford ; New York","ISBN":"978-0-19-518247-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,8,18]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"240","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"Oxford ; New York","source":"Amazon","title":"Silent Covenants: Brown v.

  {"id":"bischoff_racial_2018","abstract":"In an education system that draws students from residentially based attendance zones, schools are local institutions that reflect the racial composition of their surrounding communities. However, with opportunities to opt out of the zoned public school system, the social and economic contexts of neighborhoods may affect the demographic link between neighborhoods and their public neighborhood schools. Using spatial data on school attendance zones, we estimate the associations between the racial composition of elementary schools and their local neighborhoods, and we investigate how neighborhood factors shape the loose or tight demographic coupling of these parallel social contexts. The results show that greater social distance among residents within neighborhoods, as well as the availability of educational exit options, results in neighborhood public schools that are less reflective of their surrounding communities. In addition, we show that suburban schools are more demographically similar to their neighborhood attendance zones than are urban schools.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Bischoff","given":"Kendra"},{"family":"Tach","given":"Laura"}],"citation-key":"bischoff_racial_2018","container-title":"City & Community","DOI":"10.1111/cico.12323","ISSN":"1540-6040","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"en","page":"675-701","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The Racial Composition of Neighborhoods and Local Schools: The Role of Diversity, Inequality, and School Choice","title-short":"The Racial Composition of Neighborhoods and Local Schools","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cico.12323","volume":"17"},

Despite this increase in racial and ethnic diversity, extreme Black-White residential segregation remains the common pattern. As one of the most racially, ethnically, and culturally diverse cities in the world-and one of the most residentially segregated-Los Angeles represents the changing face of urban America. A multiracial sample of adults (N = 4025) is employed to examine neighborhood racial composition preferences-an important, individual-level explanation for residential segregation-and address three shortcomings in existing research. First, I assess composition preferences in a multiracial manner with an innovative replication and expansion of the Farley-Schuman showcard methodology used in the 1976 and 1992 Detroit Area studies. Second, I extend analysis of the cause of preferences beyond racial stereotypes to include parenting, homeownership, perceptions of social class difference, and common fate identity. Third, I test, directly, the effects of these factors on preferences for same-race neighbors. Results lend strong support to race-based explanations of preferences. As stereotypes toward out-groups become more negative, preferences for integration decrease; Blacks are consistently perceived in unfavorable terms, and are, consensually, the least preferred out-group neighbors. There is also limited support for so-called class-based explanations of preferences; homeowners prefer fewer Black neighbors. Generally, results suggest both greater resistance to integration with Blacks than previously thought, but more openness to integration than currently exists.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2011,2,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Charles","given":"Camille Zubrinsky"}],"citation-key":"charles_neighborhood_2000","container-title":"Social Problems","ISSN":"00377791","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000]]},"page":"379-407","source":"JSTOR","title":"Neighborhood Racial-Composition Preferences: Evidence from a Multiethnic Metropolis","title-short":"Neighborhood Racial-Composition Preferences","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/3097236","volume":"47"},

  {"id":"clark_interpreting_2015","abstract":"Some interpretations of migration juxtapose jobs and amenities as alternative explanations for migration and regional growth but there is substantial evidence that migrants juggle a more complex set of motivations for migration than simply the attraction of a new job or a nice place to live. Occupational opportunities, family needs, communities, and lifestyles all play competing roles when households decide to move. This has always been true for local moves but appears to be relevant in longer distance moves also. We use data from the Housing, Income, and Labour Dynamics Survey in Australia to unpack the relative role of a wide variety of responses to the question – why did you move. The paper provides evidence that while migration is clearly related to labour market opportunities, non-economic motivations including family change, lifestyle choices, and housing needs also play powerful roles in long-distance migration decisions and often come with significant economic benefits. Clearly, jobs matter but it may be that they are the context within which migration occurs rather than simply an adjustment mechanism in the labour market. Survey data confirm that most moves are not generated by jobs per se, and the distribution of gains varies considerably by gender and reason for moves. Overall, this research emphasises the complexity of modern migration decisions.

Age, tenure, and room stress (housing-space requirements) are found to be significant predictors of moving. In addition, the life course ‘triggers' of marital-status change and, in some situations, birth of a child play important roles in moving within housing markets in the United Kingdom. The same model, with somewhat lower levels of fit, is also significant for the London region. Variables that measure the desire to move and neighborhood satisfaction also play a role in predicting local moves: those who like their neighborhood are generally less likely to move.

A test of this hypothesis in the Los Angeles metropolitan area with 1990 census data at both the tract and block level suggests considerable caution in accepting the notion of stable racially mixed neighborhoods. The rate of succession seems to be related to overall levels of demographic change and the level of multiethnic integration, by at least one measure, is quite low.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2009,5,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Clark","given":"William A.

  {"id":"coulter_what_2015","abstract":"Understanding why people move home is an important objective for population research. While studies are increasingly examining residential mobility motivations using the reasons reported in social surveys, data constraints and the conceptual legacy of behavioural theories mean that little is known about how people's reasons for desiring and making residential moves vary over the life course. In this paper, we address these issues using longitudinal data from the British Household Panel Survey. The results show that the reasons people report for desiring to move vary considerably over the life course. People are more likely to relocate if they desire to move for ‘targeted’ reasons like employment opportunities than if they desire to move for more ‘diffuse’ reasons relating to area characteristics. Life course events and moving desires intersect to strongly condition moving behaviour. These insights demonstrate how a deep engagement with life course theories can help researchers to overcome the difficulties encountered when using behavioural models to understand moving decisions.

We find that despite the emergence of multiethnic neighborhoods, stratified mobility dynamics continue to dominate, with relatively few black or white households moving into neighborhoods that could be considered multiethnic. However, we also find that the tendency for white and black households to move between neighborhoods dominated by their own group varies significantly across metropolitan areas. Black and white households’ mobility into more integrated neighborhoods is shaped substantially by demographic, economic, political, and spatial features of the broader metropolitan area. Metropolitan-area racial composition, the stock of new housing, residential separation of black and white households, poverty rates, and functional specialization emerge as particularly important predictors. These macro-level effects reflect opportunities for intergroup residential contact as well as structural forces that maintain residential segregation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2014,8,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Crowder","given":"Kyle"},{"family":"Pais","given":"Jeremy"},{"family":"South","given":"Scott J."}],"citation-key":"crowder_neighborhood_2012","container-title":"American Sociological Review","container-title-short":"American Sociological Review","DOI":"10/f32s2x","ISSN":"0003-1224, 1939-8271","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"325-353","PMID":"22753955","source":"asr.sagepub.com.proxyau.wrlc.org","title":"Neighborhood Diversity, Metropolitan Constraints, and Household Migration","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://asr.sagepub.com/content/77/3/325","volume":"77"},

These neighborhood effects persist after controlling for a wide range of micro-level mobility predictors and do not appear to be rooted in the reaction to nonracial social and economic characteristics of the neighborhood.

Net of local neighborhood conditions and other predictors of residential mobility, high concentrations of minorities in surrounding neighborhoods reduce the likelihood that Whites will move, presumably by reducing the attractiveness of nearby residential alternatives. Notably, this effect also suppresses the influence of the racial composition of the immediate neighborhood on White out-migration. Recent growth in the size of an extralocal minority population increases the likelihood of White out-migration and accounts for much of the influence previously attributed to racial changes in the local neighborhood. High levels of minority concentration in surrounding neighborhoods also exacerbate the positive effect of local minority concentration on White out-migration.

However, we know little about how individuals, especially parents, understand neighborhood racial composition. We examine this question using in-depth interview data from a racially diverse sample of 156 parents of young children in two metropolitan areas. Prior scholarship on neighborhood racial preferences has mostly been animated by expectations about in-group attraction, out-group avoidance, the influence of stereotypes, and perceived associations between race and status. However, we find that a substantial subset of parents expressed a desire for racially and ethnically mixed neighborhoods—a residential preference at odds with racial segregation. Parents across race conceptualized neighborhood diversity as beneficial for children's development. They expressed shared logics, reasoning that neighborhood diversity cultivates skills and comfort interacting with racial others; teaches tolerance; and provides cultural enrichment. However, these ideas intersected with racial segregation and stratification to shape parents’ understandings of diversity and hinder the realization of parents’ aspirations. Beliefs about the benefits of neighborhood diversity were rarely a primary motivation for residential choices. Nonetheless, parents’ perceptions of the advantages of neighborhood racial mixing reveal the reach of discourse on the value of diversity and suggest a potential opportunity to advance residential desegregation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Darrah-Okike","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Harvey","given":"Hope"},{"family":"Fong","given":"Kelley"}],"citation-key":"darrah-okike_because_2020","container-title":"City & Community","DOI":"10/fzbg","ISSN":"1540-6040","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","page":"374-397","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"“Because the World Consists of Everybody”: Understanding Parents’ Preferences for Neighborhood Diversity","title-short":"“Because the World Consists of Everybody”","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cico.12445","volume":"19"},

Existing studies on the relationship between homeownership and neighbourhood satisfaction have not considered whether homeownership varies in its consequences depending on local context or racial background. Homeownership may render residents more responsive to neighbourhood conditions, to their benefit and to their detriment, depending on local context. Patterns may further vary across racial groups, given vast interracial inequalities in the attainment of desirable neighbourhood outcomes and homeownership. Employing a sample of 1897 respondents from the 2001 Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey (LAFANS), as well as data from the 2000 Census, this study uncovers a complex set of interrelationships among homeownership, neighbourhood characteristics and race. Homeownership makes residents more sensitive to the desirability of local characteristics, proving beneficial in advantaged communities and disadvantageous in distressed communities. These conclusions are broadly applicable to blacks, Latinos and whites, though homeownership is more salient among blacks and Latinos in determining their response to neighbourhood conditions. Given differential access to desirable neighbourhoods and asset accumulation across racial groups, findings raise new and important questions regarding the meaning of homeownership for minority households and their communities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Greif","given":"Meredith"}],"citation-key":"greif_intersection_2015","container-title":"Urban Studies","container-title-short":"Urban Studies","DOI":"10.1177/0042098014525243","ISSN":"0042-0980","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"50-70","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The intersection of homeownership, race and neighbourhood context: Implications for neighbourhood satisfaction","title-short":"The intersection of homeownership, race and neighbourhood context","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0042098014525243","volume":"52"},

Additionally, their presence in neighborhoods may influence other residents' attachment by triggering racial prejudice or concerns about local resources. Using the 2001 Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey (LAFANS), this analysis demonstrates that Asians and Hispanics modestly diverge from blacks and whites in the strength of their attachment, due in part to individual and neighborhood characteristics.

  {"id":"harris_why_2001","abstract":"Much research finds that both Blacks and Whites prefer to live in neighborhoods that have few Black residents. The explanation usually offered for White aversion to Black neighbors is racism. Black aversion to Black neighbors, however, is often viewed as resulting from a taste for integration or as a proxy for the desire to live in affluent, safe neighborhoods with good schools. In this article I use 1990-1993 data from the Chicago Area Survey Project to revisit the issue of neighborhood racial preferences. My analysis suggests that there are few differences in the reasons why Blacks and Whites are averse to Black neighbors. Each group prefers White neighbors because neighborhoods with many Black residents tend to have high levels of poverty, crime, and other social problems. Thus, my work is consistent with the racial proxy hypothesis and serves as a challenge to the widely held pure race hypothesis.","author":[{"family":"Harris","given":"David R."}],"citation-key":"harris_why_2001","container-title":"Social Science Research","container-title-short":"Soc Sci Res","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001]]},"note":"Journal article","page":"100-116","title":"Why Are Whites and Blacks Averse to Black Neighbors?","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6WX8-45BBY7W-11/2/6e1c91f996797cab4da5673065b77f1a","volume":"30"},

Nonetheless, research has typically not asked which characteristics explain transitions with higher social distance based on a number of demographic dimensions. We explore this question using American Housing Survey data from 1985 to 2007, and focus on instances in which the prior household moved out and is replaced by a new household. We focus on four key characteristics for explaining this social distance: the type of housing unit, the age of the housing unit, the length of residence of the exiting household, and the crime and social disorder in the neighborhood. We find that transitions in the oldest housing units and for the longest tenured residents result in the greatest amount of social distance between new and prior residents, implying that these transitions are particularly important for fostering neighborhood socio-demographic change. The results imply micro-mechanisms at the household level that might help explain net change at the neighborhood level.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Hipp","given":"John R."}],"citation-key":"hipp_neighborhood_2020","container-title":"Social Science Research","container-title-short":"Soc Sci Res","DOI":"10.1016/j.ssresearch.2019.102372","ISSN":"0049-089X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"102372","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Neighborhood change from the bottom Up: What are the determinants of social distance between new and prior residents?","title-short":"Neighborhood change from the bottom Up","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X18308810","volume":"86"},

Those perceiving more social or physical disorder were considerably less satisfied with the neighborhood, and perceiving more crime showed an accelerating negative effect on satisfaction. Furthermore, the effect of perceiving crime was exacerbated in tracts with a distressed labor market or the presence of disengaged youth. There was consistent evidence that those with more economic investment (homeowners) or social investment (married residents and parents) in the neighborhood are more satisfied.

  {"id":"holloway_racially_2012","abstract":"This article reflects on the racial configuration of urban space. Previous research tends to posit racial segregation and diversity as either endpoints on a continuum of racial dominance or mirror images of one another. We argue that segregation and diversity must be jointly understood; they are necessarily related, although not inevitably as binary opposites. Our view is that the neighborhood geographies of U.S. metropolitan areas are simultaneously and increasingly marked by both racial segregation and racial diversity. We offer an approach that classifies neighborhoods based jointly on their compositional diversity and their racial dominance, illustrated by an examination of the neighborhood racial structure of several large metropolitan areas for 1990 and 2000. Compositional diversity increased in all metropolitan areas in ways rendered visible by our approach, including a sharp reduction in the number of highly segregated white neighborhoods, transitioning mostly into moderately diverse yet still white-dominated neighborhoods, and a fourfold increase in the number of highly diverse neighborhoods. Even so, many highly segregated spaces remain, especially for whites and blacks. Latino-dominated spaces show a mix of persistence and emergence. Although compositional diversity is increasing, highly diverse neighborhoods are still rare and are the least persistent of all racial configurations. Our approach clearly demonstrates the “both/and”-ness of segregation and diversity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Holloway","given":"Steven R."},{"family":"Wright","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Ellis","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"holloway_racially_2012","container-title":"The Professional Geographer","DOI":"10.1080/00330124.2011.585080","ISSN":"0033-0124","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,2,1]]},"page":"63-82","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The Racially Fragmented City?

We address this gap by developing a conceptual framework on the social pathways of gentrification and introducing a method of systematic social observation using Google Street View to detect visible cues of neighborhood change. We argue that a durable racial hierarchy governs residential selection and, in turn, gentrifying neighborhoods. Integrating census data, police records, prior street-level observations, community surveys, proximity to amenities, and city budget data on capital investments, we find that the pace of gentrification in Chicago from 2007 to 2009 was negatively associated with the concentration of blacks and Latinos in neighborhoods that either showed signs of gentrification or were adjacent and still disinvested in 1995. Racial composition has a threshold effect, however, attenuating gentrification when the share of blacks in a neighborhood is greater than 40 percent. Consistent with theories of neighborhood stigma, we also find that collective perceptions of disorder, which are higher in poor minority neighborhoods, deter gentrification, while observed disorder does not. These results help explain the reproduction of neighborhood racial inequality amid urban transformation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Hwang","given":"Jackelyn"},{"family":"Sampson","given":"Robert J."}],"citation-key":"hwang_divergent_2014","container-title":"American Sociological Review","container-title-short":"American Sociological Review","DOI":"10.1177/0003122414535774","ISSN":"0003-1224, 1939-8271","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"726-751","source":"asr.sagepub.com.proxyau.wrlc.org","title":"Divergent Pathways of Gentrification Racial Inequality and the Social Order of Renewal in Chicago Neighborhoods","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://asr.sagepub.com.proxyau.wrlc.org/content/79/4/726","volume":"79"},

Analysis of U.S. Census and American Community Survey data over 24 years and field surveys of gentrification in low-income neighborhoods across 23 U.S. cities reveal that most gentrifying neighborhoods were “global” in the 1970s or became so over time. An early presence of Asians was positively associated with gentrification; and an early presence of Hispanics was positively associated with gentrification in neighborhoods with substantial shares of blacks and negatively associated with gentrification in cities with high Hispanic growth, where ethnic enclaves were more likely to form. Low-income, predominantly black neighborhoods and neighborhoods that became Asian and Hispanic destinations remained ungentrified despite the growth of gentrification during the late twentieth century. The findings suggest that the rise of immigration after 1965 brought pioneers to many low-income central-city neighborhoods, spurring gentrification in some neighborhoods and forming ethnic enclaves in others.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Hwang","given":"Jackelyn"}],"citation-key":"hwang_pioneers_2016","container-title":"Demography","container-title-short":"Demography","DOI":"10.1007/s13524-015-0448-4","ISSN":"0070-3370, 1533-7790","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","page":"189-213","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Pioneers of Gentrification: Transformation in Global Neighborhoods in Urban America in the Late Twentieth Century","title-short":"Pioneers of Gentrification","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13524-015-0448-4","volume":"53"},

Some scholars, politicians and real estate boosters celebrate this urban population influx, as it will likely increase property values and municipal tax bases; however, we know little about the social costs associated with the back-to-the-city movement. This study investigates the consequences of the back-to-the-city movement through a four-year (2009–2012) ethnographic case study of the revitalisation of Washington, DC’s Shaw/U Street neighbourhood. The redevelopment of this African-American neighbourhood is associated with the city’s 5.2 percent population increase, which occurred between 2000 and 2010. While affordable housing efforts help to keep a portion of long-term, low-income residents in place, political and cultural displacement is occurring as upper-income newcomers flock into this neighbourhood.

  {"id":"hyra_new_2008","abstract":"Two of the most celebrated black neighborhoods in the United States—Harlem in New York City and Bronzeville in Chicago—were once plagued by crime, drugs, and abject poverty. But now both have transformed into increasingly trendy and desirable neighborhoods with old buildings being rehabbed, new luxury condos being built, and banks opening branches in areas that were once redlined. In The New Urban Renewal, Derek S. Hyra offers an illuminating exploration of the complicated web of factors—local, national, and global—driving the remarkable revitalization of these two iconic black communities. How did these formerly notorious ghettos become dotted with expensive restaurants, health spas, and chic boutiques? And, given that urban renewal in the past often meant displacing African Americans, how have both neighborhoods remained black enclaves? Hyra combines his personal experiences as a resident of both communities with deft historical analysis to investigate who has won and who has lost in the new urban renewal. He discovers that today’s redevelopment affects African Americans differentially: the middle class benefits while lower-income residents are priced out. Federal policies affecting this process also come under scrutiny, and Hyra breaks new ground with his penetrating investigation into the ways that economic globalization interacts with local political forces to massively reshape metropolitan areas.As public housing is torn down and money floods back into cities across the United States, countless neighborhoods are being monumentally altered. The New Urban Renewal is a compelling study of the shifting dynamics of class and race at work in the contemporary urban landscape.","author":[{"family":"Hyra","given":"Derek S."}],"citation-key":"hyra_new_2008","event-place":"Chicago","ISBN":"978-0-226-36604-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,9,1]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"224","publisher":"University Of Chicago Press","publisher-place":"Chicago","source":"Amazon.com","title":"The New Urban Renewal: The Economic Transformation of Harlem and Bronzeville","title-short":"The New Urban Renewal","type":"book"},
  {"id":"hyra_race_2017","abstract":"For long-time residents of Washington, DC’s Shaw/U Street, the neighborhood has become almost unrecognizable in recent years. Where the city’s most infamous open-air drug market once stood, a farmers’ market now sells grass-fed beef and homemade duck egg ravioli. On the corner where AM.PM carryout used to dish out soul food, a new establishment markets its $28 foie gras burger. Shaw is experiencing a dramatic transformation, from “ghetto” to “gilded ghetto,” where white newcomers are rehabbing homes, developing dog parks, and paving the way for a third wave coffee shop on nearly every block. Race, Class, and Politics in the Cappuccino City is an in-depth ethnography of this gilded ghetto. Derek S. Hyra captures here a quickly gentrifying space in which long-time black residents are joined, and variously displaced, by an influx of young, white, relatively wealthy, and/or gay professionals who, in part as a result of global economic forces and the recent development of central business districts, have returned to the cities earlier generations fled decades ago. As a result, America is witnessing the emergence of what Hyra calls “cappuccino cities.” A cappuccino has essentially the same ingredients as a cup of coffee with milk, but is considered upscale, and is double the price. In Hyra’s cappuccino city, the black inner-city neighborhood undergoes enormous transformations and becomes racially “lighter” and more expensive by the year.","author":[{"family":"Hyra","given":"Derek S."}],"citation-key":"hyra_race_2017","event-place":"Chicago","ISBN":"978-0-226-44936-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,4,17]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"240","publisher":"University Of Chicago Press","publisher-place":"Chicago","source":"Amazon","title":"Race, Class, and Politics in the Cappuccino City","type":"book"},

Other investigators have argued that education increases commitment to democratic norms, but only at a superficial level. We review the arguments from that debate and then subject them to empirical test with national survey data on the intergroup beliefs, feelings, predispositions for personal contact, and policy orientations of men toward women, of whites toward blacks, and of the nonpoor toward the poor. The results of that comprehensive analysis fail to support the view either that education produces liberation from intergroup negativism or that it produces a superficial democratic commitment. With that ascertained, we depart from the confines of past debate and propose a fresh approach that rests on different assumptions about the nature of both intergroup attitudes and educational institutions. We argue that dominant social groups routinely develop ideologies that legitimize and justify the status quo, and the well-educated members of these dominant groups are the most sophisticated practitioners of their group's ideology. We interpret our data from this perspective and suggest that the well educated are but one step ahead of their peers in developing a defense of their interests that rests on qualification, individualism, obfuscation, and symbolic concessions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,22]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Jackman","given":"Mary R."},{"family":"Muha","given":"Michael J."}],"citation-key":"jackman_education_1984","container-title":"American Sociological Review","DOI":"10.2307/2095528","ISSN":"0003-1224","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[1984]]},"page":"751-769","source":"JSTOR","title":"Education and Intergroup Attitudes: Moral Enlightenment, Superficial Democratic Commitment, or Ideological Refinement?","title-short":"Education and Intergroup Attitudes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2095528","volume":"49"},

  {"id":"krysan_cycle_2017","abstract":"The Fair Housing Act of 1968 outlawed housing discrimination by race and provided an important tool for dismantling legal segregation. But almost fifty years later, residential segregation remains virtually unchanged in many metropolitan areas, particularly where large groups of racial and ethnic minorities live. Why does segregation persist at such high rates and what makes it so difficult to combat? In Cycle of Segregation, sociologists Maria Krysan and Kyle Crowder examine how everyday social processes shape residential stratification. Past neighborhood experiences, social networks, and daily activities all affect the mobility patterns of different racial groups in ways that have cemented segregation as a self-perpetuating cycle in the twenty-first century.   Through original analyses of national-level surveys and in-depth interviews with residents of Chicago, Krysan and Crowder find that residential stratification is reinforced through the biases and blind spots that individuals exhibit in their searches for housing. People rely heavily on information from friends, family, and coworkers when choosing where to live. Because these social networks tend to be racially homogenous, people are likely to receive information primarily from members of their own racial group and move to neighborhoods that are also dominated by their group. Similarly, home-seekers who report wanting to stay close to family members can end up in segregated destinations because their relatives live in those neighborhoods. The authors suggest that even absent of family ties, people gravitate toward neighborhoods that are familiar to them through their past experiences, including where they have previously lived, and where they work, shop, and spend time. Because historical segregation has shaped so many of these experiences, even these seemingly race-neutral decisions help reinforce the cycle of residential stratification. As a result, segregation has declined much more slowly than many social scientists have expected.   To overcome this cycle, Krysan and Crowder advocate multi-level policy solutions that pair inclusionary zoning and affordable housing with education and public relations campaigns that emphasize neighborhood diversity and high-opportunity areas. They argue that together, such programs can expand the number of destinations available to low-income residents and help offset the negative images many people hold about certain neighborhoods or help introduce them to places they had never considered. Cycle of Segregation demonstrates why a nuanced understanding of everyday social processes is critical for interrupting entrenched patterns of residential segregation.","author":[{"family":"Krysan","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Crowder","given":"Kyle"}],"citation-key":"krysan_cycle_2017","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-87154-490-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,12,13]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"288","publisher":"Russell Sage Foundation","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Amazon","title":"Cycle of Segregation: Social Processes and Residential Stratification","title-short":"Cycle of Segregation","type":"book"},
  {"id":"krysan_diversity_2017","abstract":"Although there is little debate that Census data reveal declines in standard measures of segregation over the past several decades, depending on who you ask, racial residential segregation is either just about gone or is stubbornly persistent. In this study, we draw attention to how the murkiness in the conceptualization of what has replaced ‘segregation’ and the related question of what integration is, contributes to this disagreement. Through an analysis of attitudes toward racially integrated neighborhoods, we demonstrate the pitfalls of our lack of consistency and clarity about the conceptual and operational definition of integration. Our analysis reveals the diversity of attitudes toward integrated communities—depending on who is asked, and what kind of integration is considered—and points to a fragility of commitment to the ideals of integration. We do this by using an innovative survey dataset that includes both open and closed-ended questions asked of a large probability sample of Whites, African Americans, and Latinos living in the Chicago metropolitan area. The survey asked individuals to describe their ideal neighborhood racial/ethnic composition and explain why it was ideal; they were then asked to describe (and explain) their least desired neighborhood racial/ethnic composition. Juxtaposing the results, we reveal that integration is both enthusiastically endorsed and much maligned—even within the same person—and that whether it is good or bad very much depends on the type of integration. We argue that appreciating the diversity of integration attitudes is critical if we are to develop a more nuanced understanding of future patterns of residential stratification in our increasingly diverse nation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Krysan","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Carter","given":"Courtney"},{"family":"Londen","given":"Marieke","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"krysan_diversity_2017","container-title":"Du Bois Review: Social Science Research on Race","DOI":"10/gchj6m","ISSN":"1742-058X, 1742-0598","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","page":"35-71","source":"Cambridge Core","title":"The Diversity of Integration in a Multiethnic Metropolis: Exploring What Whites, African Americans, and Latinos Imagine","title-short":"The Diversity of Integration in a Multiethnic Metropolis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/du-bois-review-social-science-research-on-race/article/diversity-of-integration-in-a-multiethnic-metropolis/0DA91857701752DED7DBD53E30486E3B","volume":"14"},

We conclude with a substantive application that demonstrates the utility of our multicomponent approach to researchers who are interested in assessing the “buffering hypothesis.” We find that our multicomponent approach detects higher levels of WF than recognized in previous studies, raising important questions about the formation and long-term stability of racially diverse neighborhoods in the United States.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Kye","given":"Samuel H."},{"family":"Halpern-Manners","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"kye_detecting_2019","container-title":"Sociological Methods & Research","container-title-short":"Sociological Methods & Research","DOI":"10/gj4km9","ISSN":"0049-1241","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,17]]},"language":"en","source":"SAGE Journals","status":"Advance online publication","title":"Detecting “White Flight” in the Contemporary United States: A Multicomponent Approach","title-short":"Detecting “White Flight” in the Contemporary United States","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0049124119882454"},

Using data from American cities and school districts from 2000 to 2010, we find that ethnic heterogeneity has offsetting positive and negative effects on various types of local government spending.

While many applications of ordinary least squares yield estimated regression coeﬃcients that are readily interpretable as the predicted change in y due to a unit change in x, models that involve multiplicative interactions or other complex terms are subject to less clarity of interpretation. Generalized linear models that involve transformations of this linear predictor into binary, ordinal, count or other discrete outcomes lack such ready interpretation. As such, there has been much debate in the literature about how best to interpret these more complex models (e.g., what quantities of interest to extract? what types of graphical presentations to use?). This article proposes that marginal eﬀects, speciﬁcally average marginal eﬀects, provide a uniﬁed and intuitive way of describing relationships estimated with regression. To begin, I brieﬂy discuss the challenges of interpreting complex models and review existing views on how to interpret such models, before describing average marginal eﬀects and the somewhat challenging computational task of extracting this quantity of interest from regression results.

  {"id":"lewis-mccoy_inequality_2014","abstract":"Nestled in neighborhoods of varying degrees of affluence, suburban public schools are typically better resourced than their inner-city peers and known for their extracurricular offerings and college preparatory programs. Despite the glowing opportunities that many families associate with suburban schooling, accessing a district's resources is not always straightforward, particularly for black and poorer families. Moving beyond class- and race-based explanations, Inequality in the Promised Land focuses on the everyday interactions between parents, students, teachers, and school administrators in order to understand why resources seldom trickle down to a district's racial and economic minorities. Rolling Acres Public Schools (RAPS) is one of the many well-appointed suburban school districts across the United States that has become increasingly racially and economically diverse over the last forty years. Expanding on Charles Tilly's model of relational analysis and drawing on 100 in-depth interviews as well participant observation and archival research, R. L'Heureux Lewis-McCoy examines the pathways of resources in RAPS. He discovers that―due to structural factors, social and class positions, and past experiences―resources are not valued equally among families and, even when deemed valuable, financial factors and issues of opportunity hoarding often prevent certain RAPS families from accessing that resource. In addition to its fresh and incisive insights into educational inequality, this groundbreaking book also presents valuable policy-orientated solutions for administrators, teachers, activists, and politicians.","author":[{"family":"Lewis-McCoy","given":"R.

In particular, I emphasize (1) the relationship between the growth of an ethnoburb and its economic structure, by demonstrating the changing functions of an ethno-burban ethnic economy with its extensive international connections and its close ties to the globalized mainstream economy; and (2) the nature of the San Gabriel Valley ethnoburb as a global economic outpost in the global city of Los Angeles.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Wei"}],"citation-key":"li_angeless_1998","container-title":"Urban Geography","DOI":"10.2747/0272-3638.19.6.502","ISSN":"0272-3638","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[1998,8,1]]},"page":"502-517","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Los Angeles's Chinese Ethnoburb: From Ethnic Service Center to Global Economy Outpost","title-short":"Los Angeles's Chinese Ethnoburb","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.2747/0272-3638.19.6.502","volume":"19"},
  {"id":"li_differences_2013","abstract":"Equal quality of life between groups is often assumed to be achieved once homeownership is attained. Remaining discrepancies are often considered to be due to income differences. This study explored whether established models of neighborhood satisfaction, in general, predict satisfaction for homeowners and whether documented discrepancies in levels of neighborhood satisfaction between whites and African Americans persisted among homeowners in the early 2000s. After controlling for respondent characteristics and perceived and actual neighborhood attributes, race remained important in explaining residential neighborhood satisfaction. The results indicate that African American homeowners were generally less satisfied with their neighborhoods, compared to white homeowners. The study is important because residential dissatisfaction might potentially lead to compromised quality of life or neighborhood instability and decline. Therefore urban planners and policy makers need to better understand the existence and the nature of any racial inequity to facilitate creative solutions to the problem.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Yanmei"},{"family":"Wenning","given":"Mary V."},{"family":"Morrow-Jones","given":"Hazel A."}],"citation-key":"li_differences_2013","container-title":"Housing and Society","DOI":"10.1080/08882746.2013.11430613","ISSN":"0888-2746","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,1,1]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/08882746.2013.11430613","page":"124-149","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Differences in Neighborhood Satisfaction Between African American and White Homeowners During the Early 2000s","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/08882746.2013.11430613","volume":"40"},

In this paper, we (1) compare Hispanic migration patterns in traditional settlement areas with new growth in emerging Hispanic destinations; (2) examine the role of immigration vis-à-vis domestic migration in spurring Hispanic population redistribution; and (3) document patterns of migrant selectivity, distinguishing between in-migrants and non-migrant Hispanics at both the origin and destination. We use several recent datasets, including the 1990 and 2000 Public Use Microdata Samples (which include new regional geocodes), and the 2005 and 2006 files of the American Community Survey. Our results document the widespread dispersion of the Hispanic population over the 1990–2006 period from established Hispanic gateways into new Hispanic areas and other parts of the country. Nearly one-half of Hispanic net migration in new destinations comes from domestic gains. In contrast, both established and other Hispanic areas depend entirely on immigration, with each losing domestic migrants to high growth areas. Migrant flows also are highly differentiated by education, citizenship, and nativity. To fully understand the spatial diffusion of Hispanics requires a new appreciation of the complex interplay among immigration, internal domestic migration, and fertility.","author":[{"family":"Lichter","given":"D.

Changes that may have produced greater changes for blacks proved to have insignificant effects: there was no net shift of the black population toward less-segregated areas, segregation at the metropolitan level did not decline more in areas where the incomes of blacks came closer to the incomes of whites over time, and the emergence of more multiethnic metropolises had no impact. As in the past, declines were centered in the South and West and in areas with smaller black populations. Increases in Hispanic and Asian segregation in individual metropolitan areas were counterbalanced by a net movement of these two groups toward areas of lower segregation. These increases were associated especially with the more rapid growth in the Hispanic and Asian populations. Hispanic segregation increased more in regions where group members had declining incomes relative to the incomes of whites and included a growing share of immigrants.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2008,10,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Logan","given":"John R."},{"family":"Stults","given":"Brian J."},{"family":"Farley","given":"Reynolds"}],"citation-key":"logan_segregation_2004","container-title":"Demography","ISSN":"1533-7790","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004]]},"page":"1-22","source":"Project MUSE","title":"Segregation of Minorities in the Metropolis: Two Decades of Change","title-short":"Segregation of Minorities in the Metropolis","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/demography/v041/41.1logan.html","volume":"41"},

Regression Models for Categorical Dependent Variables Using Stata, Second Edition, fills this void, showing how to fit and interpret regression models for categorical data with Stata. The authors also provide a suite of commands for hypothesis testing and model diagnostics to accompany the book. The book begins with an excellent introduction to Stata and then provides a general treatment of estimation, testing, fit, and interpretation in this class of models. It covers in detail binary, ordinal, nominal, and count outcomes in separate chapters. The final chapter discusses how to fit and interpret models with special characteristics, such as ordinal and nominal independent variables, interaction, and nonlinear terms. One appendix discusses the syntax of the author-written commands, and a second gives details of the datasets used by the authors in the book. Nearly 50% longer than the previous edition, the book covers new topics for fitting and interpreting models included in Stata 9, such as multinomial probit models, the stereotype logistic model, and zero-truncated count models. Many of the interpretation techniques have been updated to include interval as well as point estimates. New to the Second Edition:Regression models, including the zero-truncated Poisson and the zero-truncated negative binomial models, the hurdle model for counts, the stereotype logistic regression model, the rank-ordered logit model, and the multinomial probit modelStata commands, such as estat, which provides a uniform way to access statistics useful for postestimation interpretation.Expanded suite of programs known as SPostInclusion of confidence intervals for predictions computed by prvalue and prgenBecause all the examples, datasets, and author-written commands are available from the authors' Web site, readers can easily replicate the concrete examples using Stata, making it ideal for students or applied researchers who want to know how to fit and interpret models for categorical data.","author":[{"family":"Long","given":"J.

Nevertheless, the theoretical frameworks we have for describing residential settlement patterns generally treat diversity as an unstable and transitory period that is the product of a unidirectional pressure towards segregation. In our analysis of six diverse neighborhoods in Southeast Seattle, we find evidence of processes at multiple scales that not only maintain diversity, but actually reinforce it. From individual decisions about property ownership to broader patterns of regional disinvestment, we find empirical evidence that indicates a need for a more complex theorization of the processes that create and sustain diverse neighborhoods. In our preliminary theorization of these conditions, we call for a conceptualization of residential settlement patterns that is explicitly multiscalar and recognizes a wider range of cultural, economic, and political relations as central to the production of observed patterns of neighborhood settlement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Lumley-Sapanski","given":"Audrey"},{"family":"Fowler","given":"Christopher S."}],"citation-key":"lumley-sapanski_planning_2017","container-title":"City & Community","DOI":"10/f9w9nz","ISSN":"1540-6040","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","page":"86-115","title":"\"Planning Dissonance\" and the Bases for Stably Diverse Neighborhoods: The Case of South Seattle","title-short":"\"Planning Dissonance\" and the Bases for Stably Diverse Neighborhoods","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cico.12224","volume":"16"},
  {"id":"lung-amam_trespassers?:_2017","abstract":"Beyond the gilded gates of Google, little has been written about the suburban communities of Silicon Valley. Over the past several decades, the region’s booming tech economy spurred rapid population growth, increased racial diversity, and prompted an influx of immigration, especially among highly skilled and educated migrants from China, Taiwan, and India. At the same time, the response to these newcomers among long-time neighbors and city officials revealed complex attitudes in even the most well-heeled and diverse communities.  Trespassers? takes an intimate look at the everyday life and politics inside Silicon Valley against a backdrop of these dramatic demographic shifts. At the broadest level, it raises questions about the rights of diverse populations to their own piece of the suburban American Dream. It follows one community over several decades as it transforms from a sleepy rural town to a global gateway and one of the nation's largest Asian American–majority cities. There, it highlights the passionate efforts of Asian Americans to make Silicon Valley their home by investing in local schools, neighborhoods, and shopping centers. It also provides a textured tale of the tensions that emerge over this suburb's changing environment. With vivid storytelling, Trespassers? uncovers suburbia as an increasingly important place for immigrants and minorities to register their claims for equality and inclusion.","author":[{"family":"Lung-Amam","given":"Willow"}],"citation-key":"lung-amam_trespassers?:_2017","event-place":"Oakland, California","ISBN":"978-0-520-29390-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,5,16]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"264","publisher":"University of California Press","publisher-place":"Oakland, California","source":"Amazon","title":"Trespassers?: Asian Americans and the Battle for Suburbia","title-short":"Trespassers?","type":"book"},

Instead of telling about these places, the media regularly report on the continued legacy of racial and ethnic tensions in the United States. As the Nation is becoming more racially and ethnically diverse and the 21st century approaches, social scientists see possibilities of a patchwork of segregated urban neighborhoods or options for more diversity within our neighborhoods. Although diversity and multiculturalism are words in vogue, the current controversy about affirmative action suggests that there is hardly any consensus on the state or progress of race relations in the United States. In private conversations, out of public scrutiny, skepticism about the practicality of diversity--particularly diverse residential neighborhoods--is apparent. The politics of race is such a tinderbox that many dare not suggest a variation from business as usual, for fear of igniting caustic debates over this country's history of racism and ethno-centrism and over what our future could look like. To some, the civil rights movement has been relegated to the halls of history--it is viewed as a movement of days past to be recognized and celebrated once a year.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2010,9,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Nyden","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Lukehart","given":"John"},{"family":"Maly","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Peterman","given":"William"}],"citation-key":"nyden_neighborhood_1998","container-title":"Cityscape","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1998]]},"page":"1-17","source":"SSRN","title":"Neighborhood Racial and Ethnic Diversity in U.S. Cities","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=149389","volume":"4"},
  {"id":"oliver_intergroup_2003","abstract":"This article examines how out-group perceptions among Asian Americans, blacks, Latinos, and whites vary with the racial composition of their surroundings. Previous research on the contextual determinants of racial attitudes offers mixed expectations: some studies indicate that larger percentages of proximate out-groups generate intergroup conflict and hostility while others suggest that such environments promote interracial contact and understanding. As most of this research has been directed at black-white relations, the applicability of these theories to a multiethnic context remains unclear. Using data that merge the 1992–1994 Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality and 1990 Census, we find that in neighborhood contexts, interethnic propinquity corresponds with lower levels of out-group prejudice and competition, although intergroup hostility is higher in metropolitan areas with greater minority populations. Further tests suggest that these results do not occur from individual self-selection; rather ethnic spatial and social isolation bolster negative out-group perceptions. These findings suggest the value of residential integration for alleviating ethnic antagonism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Oliver","given":"J.

The authors draw on intrametropolitan mobility data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, linked to social and economic data measured at the metropolitan, place, and block levels. First, analyses show that the exodus of whites is significantly lower in predominantly white suburbs than in places with racially diverse populations. Most suburban whites have mostly white neighbors, a pattern reinforced by white residential mobility. Second, suburban whites who move tend to choose predominantly white communities with mostly white neighbors. Third, patterns of white intrametropolitan suburban mobility and minority avoidance are highly segmented. Affluent whites are seemingly better positioned to leave diversifying places for mostly white communities with white neighbors. White residential mobility, from more diverse to less diverse suburban places, builds on most previous studies emphasizing neighborhood-to-neighborhood mobility in metropolitan areas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Parisi","given":"Domenico"},{"family":"Lichter","given":"Daniel T."},{"family":"Taquino","given":"Michael C."}],"citation-key":"parisi_remaking_2019","container-title":"Socius","container-title-short":"Socius","DOI":"10.1177/2378023119854882","ISSN":"2378-0231","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-18","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Remaking Metropolitan America?

Housing satisfaction and the general appearance of the neighbourhood were closely associated with neighbourhood dissatisfaction, although perceptions of noise, friendliness, community spirit, schools and crime were also important. Although sociodemographic factors were much less important than residential perceptions in helping to predict dissatisfaction, the type of neighbourhood remained a signi cant independent predictor of dissatisfaction even when residents’ views were taken into account. Some factors were more important in different areas: in particular, residents in less af uent areas were more sensitive to unfriendliness and crime. There were also indications that owneroccupiers were less satis ed in areas where they had a lower tenure share.

Greater presence of blacks, Latinos, or Asians in neighborhoods and congregations of whites predicts favorable attitudes among whites toward interracial marriage with each respective racial group. A higher proportion of Latinos in the workplace also predicts support for racial exogamy with Latinos. Many of these effects, however, are reduced when interracial friendship is included in models, suggesting that the effect of interracial contact on intermarriage attitudes is mediated by whether or not whites develop interracial friendships within settings of cross-race interaction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Perry","given":"Samuel L."}],"citation-key":"perry_racial_2013","container-title":"The Social Science Journal","container-title-short":"The Social Science Journal","DOI":"10.1016/j.soscij.2012.09.001","ISSN":"0362-3319","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,3,1]]},"page":"13-22","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Racial composition of social settings, interracial friendship, and whites’ attitudes toward interracial marriage","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0362331912000729","volume":"50"},

To investigate this concept, we use statistical and cartographic methods to analyze tract-level Census data of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, a case study that is both representative and unique.

New evidence from the US suggests that in ethnically diverse neighbourhoods residents of all races tend to ‘hunker down’.

However, given patterns of gentrification, white flight, and micro-segregation, diversity in place does not necessarily translate into social integration in other spheres of life. Using the case of public education, I explore how residential integration represents a narrowing of social distance between racial and ethnic groups. I estimate associations between the racial and ethnic composition of schools and the diverse and racially integrated communities in which they are nested. Further, I investigate other contextual factors that may facilitate or obstruct integration in schools. Results suggest that racially integrated communities support whiter and more diverse student bodies compared to more segregated settings. Both school-level white student enrollment and multiethnic diversity occur at higher-levels in the suburbs and at the rural-urban interface compared to urban districts. These findings indicate a blurring of racial boundaries where whites that live in racially integrated communities send their youth to schools with students of color, which will impact racial stratification in the coming decades as the US becomes majority people of color.","author":[{"family":"Rastogi","given":"Ankit"}],"citation-key":"rastogi_impacts_2019","event":"Population Association of America","event-place":"Austin, Texas","genre":"Unpublished manuscript","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4]]},"publisher-place":"Austin, Texas","title":"The Impacts of Residential Integration on School Racial and Ethnic Composition","type":"speech"},

We draw from qualitative and quantitative data truly unique to the literature, reflecting approximately 750 instances of housing discrimination—discrimination verified by civil rights investigators following state and federal guidelines. Quantitative patterns denote unique and disparate vulnerability, especially for African American women, and the centrality of powerful institutional (i.e., banks, realtors, insurance companies, etc.) and more proximate actors (i.e., landlords and neighbors) in reifying racial disadvantage. Landlords are clearly on the \"front line\" with regard to both exclusionary and nonexclusionary forms. Neighbors, realtors, banks, and mortgage companies play a role as well, more or less, depending on the form of discrimination being examined. Qualitative immersion into case materials offers important insight on relevant processes pertaining to victim vulnerability and status, and how discriminatory actions themselves occur. We conclude by discussing the implications of our arguments and findings for future analyses of race and housing inequality, and for understanding stratification and its microinteractional dimensions generally.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Roscigno","given":"Vincent J."},{"family":"Karafin","given":"Diana L."},{"family":"Tester","given":"Griff"}],"citation-key":"roscigno_complexities_2009","container-title":"Social Problems","DOI":"10.1525/sp.2009.56.1.49","ISSN":"0037-7791","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"page":"49-69","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Complexities and Processes of Racial Housing Discrimination","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/sp.2009.56.1.49","volume":"56"},

I aim to rethink the processes generating 'gentrification' and 'gentrifiers' and our 'ways of seeing' the results of these processes. First, I address epistemological problems of neoclassical and marxist approaches to this subject. Second, I critically appraise the problématique of marxist work on gentrification, emphasising its lack of attention to the interrelationships of employment restructuring and changes in the reproduction of labour power. From this, I argue that gentrification is a 'chaotic concept' and that the processes and elements it comprises need to be thought through again. I begin this task by attempting to disaggregate the concept with empirical reference to North American metropolitan inner cities. I hypothesise that the upsurge of renovation activity by and for moderate-income households and those with so-called alternative life-styles is produced by the interaction of changes in production and reproduction. Further research is needed in this area.

  {"id":"rugh_segregation_2014","abstract":"In this paper we adjudicate between competing claims of persisting segregation and rapid integration by analyzing trends in residential dissimilarity and spatial isolation for African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians living in 287 consistently defined metropolitan areas from 1970 to 2010. On average, Black segregation and isolation have fallen steadily but still remain very high in many areas, particularly those areas historically characterized by hypersegregation. In contrast, Hispanic segregation has increased slightly but Hispanic isolation has risen substantially owing to rapid population growth. Asian segregation has changed little and remains moderate, and although Asian isolation has increased it remains at low levels compared with other groups. Whites remain quite isolated from all three minority groups in metropolitan America, despite rising diversity and some shifts toward integration from the minority viewpoint. Multivariate analyses reveal that minority segregation and spatial isolation are actively produced in some areas by restrictive density zoning regimes, large and/or rising minority percentages, lagging minority socioeconomic status, and active expressions of anti-Black and anti-Latino sentiment, especially in large metropolitan areas. Areas displaying these characteristics are either integrating very slowly (in the case of Blacks) or becoming more segregated (in the case of Hispanics), whereas those lacking these attributes are clearly moving toward integration, often quite rapidly.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2015,5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Rugh","given":"Jacob S."},{"family":"Massey","given":"Douglas S."}],"citation-key":"rugh_segregation_2014","container-title":"Du Bois Review: Social Science Research on Race","DOI":"10.1017/S1742058X13000180","ISSN":"1742-0598","issue":"02","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,9]]},"page":"205–232","source":"Cambridge Journals Online","title":"Segregation in Post Civil-Rights America: Stalled Integration or End of the Segregated Century?","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S1742058X13000180","volume":"11"},

As the concentration of minority groups and poverty increases, residents of all races perceive heightened disorder even after we account for an extensive array of personal characteristics and independently observed neighborhood conditions. Seeing disorder appears to be imbued with social meanings that go well beyond what essentialist theories imply, generating self-reinforcing processes that may help account for the perpetuation of urban racial inequality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2009,1,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Sampson","given":"Robert J."},{"family":"Raudenbush","given":"Stephen W."}],"citation-key":"sampson_seeing_2004","container-title":"Social Psychology Quarterly","container-title-short":"Soc Psychol Q","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,12]]},"page":"319-342","source":"IngentaConnect","title":"Seeing Disorder: Neighborhood Stigma and the Social Construction of \"Broken Windows\"","title-short":"Seeing Disorder","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://spq.sagepub.com/content/67/4/319.abstract","volume":"67"},

A second model is analytic and deals with compartmented space.  A final section applies the analytics to 'neighborhood tipping.' The systemic effects are found to be overwhelming: there is no simple correspondence of individual incentive to collective results.  Exaggerated separation and patterning result from the dynamics of movement.  Inferences about individual motives can usually not be drawn from aggregate patterns.  Some unexpected phenomena, like density and vacancy, are generated.

Among both blacks and whites, age, home ownership, being married, and having children are all inversely related to the probability of moving from the tract of origin. Conditional on moving, higher socioeconomic status increases the likelihood of moving to a \"whiter\" tract. Among blacks, a greater supply of new housing in the metropolitan area increases mobility into whiter tracts, while a higher percentage of the metropolitan area population living in the suburbs and a higher percentage of blacks in the population reduce this probability. Blacks exhibit low rates of moving into white tracts, but high rates of moving out, while the reverse mobility streams dominate among whites. Little of the racial differences in the probability of moving from a racially-mixed to a predominantly white tract can be attributed to racial differences in socioeconomic status, life-cycle characteristics, or geographic location.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2010,9,3]]},"author":[{"family":"South","given":"Scott J."},{"family":"Crowder","given":"Kyle D."}],"citation-key":"south_leaving_1998","container-title":"American Sociological Review","ISSN":"00031224","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1998,2]]},"page":"17-26","source":"JSTOR","title":"Leaving the 'Hood: Residential Mobility between Black, White, and Integrated Neighborhoods","title-short":"Leaving the 'Hood","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2657474","volume":"63"},

The study found that, despite the racial diversity present within many neighborhood spaces, spatial and temporal micro-segregation limits cross-racial social interactions. Further, though residents regularly traverse racial-spatial boundaries in the neighborhood, the temporary and shallow nature of these crossings contributes to a persistence in social distance between people from different racial groups.

  {"id":"swaroop_determinants_2011","abstract":"Understanding the factors that drive individuals' residential preferences is a critical issue in the study of racial segregation. An important debate within this field is whether individuals—especially whites—prefer to live in predominantly white neighborhoods because they wish to avoid the social problems that may be more likely to occur in predominantly black neighborhoods (i.e., the racial proxy hypothesis) or because of racial factors that go beyond these social class-related characteristics. Through a multilevel analysis of data from the 2004-2005 Chicago Area Study and several administrative sources, we assess the extent to which the racial proxy hypothesis describes neighborhood satisfaction among whites, African Americans, and Latinos living across a broad range of neighborhood contexts. The racial proxy perspective applies weakly to whites' satisfaction: whites report less satisfaction in neighborhoods with more minority residents, and only some of their dissatisfaction can be attributed to local social characteristics. The racial proxy hypothesis applies more strongly to blacks' and Latinos' satisfaction. In some cases, especially for Latinos, higher levels of satisfaction in integrated neighborhoods can largely be attributed to the fact that these places have better socioeconomic conditions and fewer social problems than predominantly minority communities. At the same time, effects of racial/ethnic composition persist in unique and somewhat divergent ways for blacks and Latinos, supporting the assertion that racial composition matters, above and beyond its relation to social class. Taken together, these findings suggest that individuals balance both socioeconomic and race-related concerns in their residential preferences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Swaroop","given":"Sapna"},{"family":"Krysan","given":"Maria"}],"citation-key":"swaroop_determinants_2011","container-title":"Demography","container-title-short":"Demography","ISSN":"0070-3370","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"page":"1203-1229","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Determinants of Neighborhood Satisfaction: Racial Proxy Revisited","title-short":"The Determinants of Neighborhood Satisfaction","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org.proxyau.wrlc.org/stable/41237830","volume":"48"},

Guided by a clear conceptual framework, we structure the empirical results of 90 recent studies and observe three patterns. We ﬁnd that (a) there is consistent support for the constrict claim for aspects of social cohesion that are spatially bounded to neighborhoods, (b) support for the constrict claim is more common in the United States than in other countries, and (c) ethnic diversity is not related to less interethnic social cohesion.

This qualitative study focuses a cultural lens on social relationships in two stably diverse neighborhoods, mapping the connections between what the author terms “habits of whiteness” and dimensions of racial domination. One of the habits is anxiety, exhibited as an amplified sense of danger in multiethnic spaces, which results in greater social control due to a normative emphasis on social order, rules, and surveillance. A second is ambivalence, which manifests as the ability to simultaneously express appreciation for yet feel discomfort about multiethnic diversity, and it results in social distance as people limit their engagement with “others” and legitimize social and geographic boundaries as natural. This study thus contributes a detailed cultural understanding of the processes that reproduce racial hierarchy in stably multiethnic spaces.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Walton","given":"Emily"}],"citation-key":"walton_habits_2021","container-title":"Sociology of Race and Ethnicity","container-title-short":"Sociol Race Ethn (Thousand Oaks, Calif.)","DOI":"10.1177/2332649218815238","ISSN":"2332-6492","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"71-85","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Habits of Whiteness: How Racial Domination Persists in Multiethnic Neighborhoods","title-short":"Habits of Whiteness","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2332649218815238","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"walton_multiethnic_2016","abstract":"As our nation and our neighborhoods increasingly diversify, we should understand how to sustain integrated communities that are equally beneficial for all residents. Though our policies encourage diversity as a theoretical social good, we actually know little about what happens on the ground in multiethnic neighborhoods. We conduct a comparative case study of the only two Boston neighborhoods to have maintained at least 10% representation of four racial and ethnic groups over the past two decades. Using survey data and ethnographic field observations, we examine residents’ experiences in these two consistently multiethnic, yet very different, neighborhoods. We find that neighborhood socioeconomic and racial inequality and disadvantage matter for residents’ access to neighborhood resources and constraints, and their perceptions of sense of community. Notably, in the highly unequal South End, Whites and homeowners have greater access to amenities and have higher perceptions of sense of community in comparison to racial and ethnic minorities and renters. Socioeconomic disadvantage matters in Fields Corner, as evidenced by lower overall perceptions of sense of community and greater exposure to safety concerns among all groups in this neighborhood compared to residents of the South End. In the end, we argue that having multiple groups simply sharing neighborhood space over a stable period is not enough to overcome the social problems associated with residential segregation and isolation. In order to support equitable neighborhood integration amid the changing face of diversity, we should take cues from “diverse by direction” neighborhood models that include active organization and coalition building among dissimilar racial and ethnic groups.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Walton","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Hardebeck","given":"Mae"}],"citation-key":"walton_multiethnic_2016","container-title":"Du Bois Review: Social Science Research on Race","container-title-short":"Du Bois Rev","DOI":"10/f9b22v","ISSN":"1742-058X, 1742-0598","issue":"2","issued":{"literal":"2016/ed"},"language":"en","page":"345-363","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Multiethnic Neighborhoods on the Ground: Resources, Constraints, and Sense of Community","title-short":"Multiethnic Neighborhoods on the Ground","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/du-bois-review-social-science-research-on-race/article/multiethnic-neighborhoods-on-the-ground/B8F09688EBE1E3B9E7E7E339667A0412","volume":"13"},

Social disorder has the most widespread negative impact on different types of neighborhood attachment. My results also show that victimization and perceptions of crime affect only problem solving; indeed, they actually increase this form of attachment. This finding suggests that a multidimensional approach to neighborhood attachment is useful, especially when applied to theories of social disorganization and loss of community.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Woldoff","given":"Rachael A."}],"citation-key":"woldoff_effects_2002","container-title":"Social Forces","container-title-short":"Soc Forces","DOI":"10.1353/sof.2002.0065","ISSN":"0037-7732, 1534-7605","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"87-116","source":"Crossref","title":"The Effects of Local Stressors on Neighborhood Attachment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/sf/article-lookup/doi/10.1353/sof.2002.0065","volume":"81"},
  {"id":"woldoff_white_2011","abstract":"Urban residential integration is often fleeting-a brief snapshot that belies a complex process of racial turnover in many U.S. cities. White Flight/Black Flight takes readers inside a neighborhood that has shifted rapidly and dramatically in race composition over the last two decades. The book presents a portrait of the life of a working-class neighborhood in the aftermath of white flight, illustrating cultural clashes that accompany racial change as well as common values that transcend race, from the perspectives of three different groups who are living it: white stayers, black pioneers, and &quot;second-wave&quot; blacks.Rachael A. Woldoff offers a fresh look at race and neighborhoods by documenting a two-stage process of neighborhood transition and focusing on the perspectives of two understudied groups: newly arriving black residents and whites who have stayed in the neighborhood. Woldoff describes the period of transition when white residents still remain, though in diminishing numbers, and a second, less discussed stage of racial change: black flight. She reveals what happens after white flight is complete: \"Pioneer\" blacks flee to other neighborhoods or else adjust to their new segregated residential environment by coping with the loss of relationships with their longer-term white neighbors, signs of community decline, and conflicts with the incoming second wave of black neighbors.Readers will find several surprising and compelling twists to the white flight story related to positive relations between elderly stayers and the striving pioneers, conflict among black residents, and differences in cultural understandings of what constitutes crime and disorder.","author":[{"family":"Woldoff","given":"Rachael A."}],"citation-key":"woldoff_white_2011","event-place":"Ithaca, New York","ISBN":"978-0-8014-6151-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,2,23]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"265","publisher":"Cornell University Press","publisher-place":"Ithaca, New York","source":"Google Books","title":"White Flight/Black Flight: The Dynamics of Racial Change in an American Neighborhood","title-short":"White Flight/Black Flight","type":"book"},

  {"id":"wright_instability_2020","abstract":"This research concerns the location and stability of highly racially diverse census tracts in the United States. Like some other scholars, the authors define such tracts conservatively, requiring the significant presence of at least three racialized groups. Of the approximately 65,000 tracts in the country, there were 197 highly diverse tracts in 1990 and 998 in 2010. Most were located in large metropolitan areas. Stably integrated highly diverse tracts were the exception rather than the rule. The vast majority of highly diverse tracts transitioned to that state from being predominantly White. Those that transitioned from being highly racially diverse were most likely to transition to being majority Latino. Although the absolute level of metropolitan racial diversity has no effect on the stability of high-diversity tracts, change in both metropolitan-scale racial diversity and population raise the probability of a tract’s transitioning to high diversity. Metropolitan-scale racial diversity did not affect the stability of highly diverse tracts, but it did alter the patterns of succession from them. The authors also found that highly diverse tracts were unstable and less likely to form in metropolitan areas with high percentages of Blacks. Increased metropolitan-level diversity mutes this Black population share effect by reducing the probability of high-diversity tract succession to a Black majority.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Wright","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Ellis","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Holloway","given":"Steven R."},{"family":"Catney","given":"Gemma"}],"citation-key":"wright_instability_2020","container-title":"Sociology of Race and Ethnicity","container-title-short":"Sociol Race Ethn (Thousand Oaks, Calif.)","DOI":"10/gj4knh","ISSN":"2332-6492","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"365-381","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The Instability of Highly Racially Diverse Residential Neighborhoods in the United States","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2332649218819168","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"wright_mixed_2020","abstract":"Focusing on neighborhoods that researchers consider particularly diverse, this paper assesses the ways scholars have characterized neighborhood racial diversity in the United States. Social scientists use a variety of methods to define and measure highly racially diverse places, resulting in a single label being used to capture very different aspects of a census tract’s racial demography. We examine the criteria used to classify neighborhood racial diversity to bring perspective on the logic behind various approaches. We then group the range of schemas into several broad types from which we choose a representative four. These form the basis for a series of empirical comparisons using U.S. Census data to reveal the contexts where the taxonomies produce similar outcomes and those where they do not. The analysis goes on to consider the implications stemming from the choices social scientists make when they opt for one approach over another.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Wright","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Ellis","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Holloway","given":"Steven R."},{"family":"Golriz","given":"Mehrnush"}],"citation-key":"wright_mixed_2020","container-title":"Urban Geography","container-title-short":"Urban Geogr","DOI":"10.1080/02723638.2020.1756056","ISSN":"0272-3638","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,4]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2020.1756056","page":"1-23","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Mixed measures: different definitions of racially diverse neighborhoods compared","title-short":"Mixed measures","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2020.1756056","volume":"0"},
  {"id":"xie_modeling_2012","abstract":"We investigate the dynamic relationship between residential choices of individuals and resulting long-term aggregate segregation patterns, allowing for feedback effects of macrolevel neighborhood conditions on residential choices. We reinterpret past survey data on whites’ attitudes about desired neighborhoods as revealing large heterogeneity in whites’ tolerance of black neighbors. Through agent-based modeling, we improve on a previous model of residential racial segregation by introducing individual-level heterogeneity in racial tolerance. Our model predicts, in the long run, a lower level of residential racial segregation than would be true with homogeneous racial tolerance. Further analysis shows that whites’ tolerance of black neighbors is closely associated with their overall racial attitudes toward blacks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Xie","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Xiang"}],"citation-key":"xie_modeling_2012","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1202218109","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"29","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,7,17]]},"language":"en","page":"11646-11651","PMID":"22753466","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Modeling individual-level heterogeneity in racial residential segregation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/109/29/11646","volume":"109"},
  {"id":"zhang_global_2016","abstract":"Neighborhoods where blacks and whites live in integrated settings alongside Hispanics and Asians represent a new phenomenon in the United States. These “global neighborhoods” have previously been identified in the nation’s most diverse metropolitan centers. This study examines the full range of metropolitan areas to ask whether similar processes are occurring in other parts of the country. Is there evidence of stable racial integration in places that lack such diversity? What are the paths of neighborhood change in areas with few Hispanic or Asian residents, or areas where Hispanics are the principal minority group, or where there is no large minority presence at all? We distinguish four types of metropolitan regions: white, white/black, white/Hispanic/Asian, and multiethnic. These regions necessarily differ greatly in neighborhood composition, but some similar trajectories of neighborhood change are found in all of them. The results provide new evidence of the effect of Hispanic and Asian presence on black-white segregation in all parts of the country.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Wenquan"},{"family":"Logan","given":"John R."}],"citation-key":"zhang_global_2016","container-title":"Demography","container-title-short":"Demography","DOI":"10/f9fcq4","ISSN":"1533-7790","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1933-1953","source":"Springer Link","title":"Global Neighborhoods: Beyond the Multiethnic Metropolis","title-short":"Global Neighborhoods","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13524-016-0516-4","volume":"53"},
