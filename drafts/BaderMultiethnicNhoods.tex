\noindent Racially integrated neighborhoods have become more numerous in the landscape of American metropolitan areas. While they were once unstable rarities, integrated neighborhoods have become both more common and more stable \needcite. Previous studies estimate \TK\ to \TK\ percent of metropolitan neighborhoods to be racially integrated, depending on the method used to classify integration. More tolerant racial attitudes among whites, preferences for racially integrated neighborhoods among people of color, and federal policies outlawing discrimination have helped the number of multiethnic neighborhoods grow \needcite. Integration has been bolstered by the expanding diversity of U.S.\ population, especially from the immigration and natural growth of Latinos and Asian-Americans, have increased. 

Maintaining integration over time depends on residents with different racial identities being satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods. Differences in neighborhood satisfaction across racial groups would lead to some groups being likely to leave the neighborhood, thereby imperiling the racial composition and could set neighborhoods on a trajectory toward integration. Despite the relevance of this question for predicting the long-term stability of racial integration, we do not know whether satisfaction with integrated neighborhoods varies across racial groups. 

This article addresses the shortcoming of previous research by studying levels of satisfaction among residents of integrated neighborhoods. Unlike previous research that focuses on a handful of integrated neighborhoods, this article examines neighborhood satisfaction using data from a large representative sample of residents living in integrated neighborhoods in a metropolitan area. The results reveal few racial differences in how satisfied residents feel living in integrated neighborhoods and in how they perceive the direction of the neighborhood. Yet, whites are less likely to consider moving to one of the other integrated neighborhoods in the metropolitan area, possibly reducing the chances that integration can be maintained over time. 

\section{Rise of Multiethnic Neighborhoods}

Invasion\slash succession

Ellen studied long-term integration

More recent studies show evidence that long-term integration is becoming the norm

Factors that increase probability of integrated neighborhoods

Two most common types of integrated neighborhoods: quadrivial and Latino\slash white neighborhoods

Where are multiethnic neighborhoods? 

\section{Life in Multiethnic Neighborhoods}

In general past research has found residents to be satisfied living in integrated neighborhoods.

But results tend to come from case-studies of specific neighborhoods. These have tended to be concentrated in central cities, not the suburbs.

Other studies have examined specific, often high-profile integrated neighborhoods such as Mount Airy and Oak Park. 

Previous studies do not provide an adequate picture of conditions in contemporary multiethnic neighborhoods.

\section{Data and Methods}
\subsection{Setting}
This study uses data from the Washington, D.C. area. It is a large city with high levels of segregation, like many other cities. 

It differs, however, in its overall wealth, the size of its black middle class and presence of immigrants with high and low levels of education. 

Description of quadrivial and disproportionately Latiino neighborhoods in the DC area

\subsection{Sample}
The 2016 D.C.\ Area Study was conducted in March-May 2016. Multi-stage design that selected households in Census tracts in the District of Columbia and neighboring jurisdictions that fell into one of two categories: quadrivial neighborhoods or disproportionately Latino neighborhoods. (Defns) Household PAPI survey mailed to households in equal proportion across the two neighborhoods. 

Survey weights were created so that the survey would represent all residents of quadrivial and disproportionately Latino neighborhoods in the D.C.\ area.
