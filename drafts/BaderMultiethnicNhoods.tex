\title{Satisfaction and Stability in Multiethnic Neighborhoods}
\author{Michael D.M.~Bader}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\noindent Racially integrated neighborhoods have become more numerous in the landscape of American metropolitan areas. While they were once unstable rarities, integrated neighborhoods have become both more common and more stable \needcite. Previous studies estimate \TK\ to \TK\ percent of metropolitan neighborhoods to be racially integrated, depending on the method used to classify integration. More tolerant racial attitudes among whites, preferences for racially integrated neighborhoods among people of color, and federal policies outlawing discrimination have helped the number of multiethnic neighborhoods grow \needcite. Integration has been bolstered by the expanding diversity of U.S.\ population, especially from the immigration and natural growth of Latinos and Asian-Americans, have increased. 

Maintaining integration over time depends on residents with different racial identities being satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods. Differences in neighborhood satisfaction across racial groups would lead to some groups being likely to leave the neighborhood, thereby imperiling the racial composition and could set neighborhoods on a trajectory toward integration. Despite the relevance of this question for predicting the long-term stability of racial integration, we do not know whether satisfaction with integrated neighborhoods varies across racial groups. 

This article addresses the shortcoming of previous research by studying levels of satisfaction among residents of integrated neighborhoods. Unlike previous research that focuses on a handful of integrated neighborhoods, this article examines neighborhood satisfaction using data from a large representative sample of residents living in integrated neighborhoods in a metropolitan area. The results reveal few racial differences in how satisfied residents feel living in integrated neighborhoods and in how they perceive the direction of the neighborhood. Yet, whites are less likely to consider moving to one of the other integrated neighborhoods in the metropolitan area, possibly reducing the chances that integration can be maintained over time. 

\section{Rise of Multiethnic Neighborhoods}
The human ecological model of neighborhood change developed by Park and colleagues (\needcite) applied for most of the twentieth century. One or two households of a racial or ethnic group would ``invade'' a neighborhood where the majority of residents identified as another group. After this initial invasion, change would proceed rapidly as the incumbents would leave and the more members of the new racial group would enter. The model explained racial change associated with white flight particularly well as neighborhoods would change rapidly once the mobility pattern took hold \needcite. 

The pattern of rapid succession, however, slowed during the 1980s and 1990s. White residents tended not to flee neighborhoods as people of color moved into their neighborhoods. Ellen \needcite documented the rise of durable racial integration and the possibility that racial segregation should not be a foregone conclusion. Contrary to the hypothesis of invasion and succession, she showed that racial change occurred very slowly in integrated neighborhoods. Since Ellen's work, several studies have documented the fact that integrated neighborhoods represent a plurality of American neighborhoods. Integration became probable a few decades after many questioned whether it was even possible. 

Several factors led to the growth of integrated neighborhoods. First, federal, state, and local civil rights legislation provided a legal basis for people of color, especially blacks, to enter previously all-white neighborhoods. Second, the American population became more diverse as immigration led to more people of color living in the United States. Third, the rising economic position among people of color (supported by civil rights legislation against discrimination) allowed more people of color to enter neighborhoods that had been previously unavailable. Finally, whites have become more racially tolerant of being neighbors with people of color. 

These forces led to the growth of two specific types of racially integrated neighborhoods. The first are ``quadrivial neighborhoods'' in which white, black, Latino, and Asian residents live in proportion to their representation in the overall population.
\footnote{Logan and Zhang \needcite\ called these neighborhoods ``global neighborhoods.'' I prefer to follow Bader and Warkentien \needcite\ who used the term ``quadrivial'' neighborhoods, who used the Latin term meaning four roads coming to an intersection. The term ``global'' implies non-white residents of the neighborhood are foreign born rather than being as American as white residents.}
Estimates regarding the number of quadrivial neighborhoods range from an estimate of fifteen percent to \TK\ based on Logan and Zhang \needcite. 

The type comprises neighborhoods in which the Latinx population has grown but a substantial number of whites still live in the neighborhood. Evidence shows that this type of neighborhood makes up the majority or a substantial plurality of integrated neighborhoods. These neighborhoods might include other racial groups, more often Asian than black, at smaller percentages of the composition \needcite. While integrated, evidence suggests integration as a temporary phenomenon. Farrell and Lee \needcite\ show that Latinos are simultaneously the group most likely to integrate a racially homogenous neighborhood \emph{and} experience increasing isolation. Bader and Warkentien \needcite\ estimate the rate of change in neighborhoods in which whites and Latinos make up the two largest groups in the population, and find that the neighborhoods are on pace to resegregate as all-Latino neighborhoods.

\section{Satisfaction Living in Multiethnic Neighborhoods}
Research on life in multiethnic neighborhoods has not kept pace with the increasing prevalence of multiethnic neighborhoods in American metropolitan areas. Among the studies that exist, most find that residents are satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods \needcite. Most of the research on integrated neighborhoods comes from case-studies of residents integrated neighborhoods. 

Some case studies focus on multiethnic neighborhoods in central cities like Roger's Park in Chicago or Jackson Heights in Queens. \textbf{TK: more on specific studies about integrated neighborhoods}. Another source of case studies come from inner ring suburbs that have taken proactive steps to maintain explicit integration. Places like Oak Park, Illinois, Shaker Heights, Ohio, and Mount Airy, Pennsylvania offer case studies for how to actively manage and maintain integration. 

While useful, the cases presented in this research do not reflect where multiethnic neighborhoods exist today. The most diverse neighborhoods, the quadrivial neighborhoods, tend to be found in the middle-ring suburbs of American metropolitan areas. These were places where a majority of the housing stock tended to be built after the Fair Housing Act passed in 1968 and located among major transportation corridors. Integration is more often found in places like Naperville, Illnois (outside of Chicago), Sugar Land, Texas (outside of Houston), Germantown, Maryland (outside of Washington, D.C.) than in the well-known central city and activist suburban neighborhoods. 

The same is true of disproportionately Latino neighborhoods. While popular imagination and research alike tend to focus on central city ethnic enclaves, immigrants now often bypass those neighborhoods to move to suburban enclaves. Native-born Latinos, especially those who have experienced upward mobility, have dispersed throughout metropolitan areas. 

While case studies of specific neighborhoods provide valuable insights, they do not capture the contemporary conditions of racially integrated neighborhoods. We need data from residents of to understand the future of integration in U.S.\ society. Knowing whether racial groups derive different levels of satisfaction from living in integrated neighborhoods will help ascertain whether groups feel socially integrated and predict how stable integration will be in multiracial neighborhoods. This study uses data from a representative sample of residents living in multiracial neighborhoods in the Washington, D.C.\ metropolitan area. It investigates whether neighborhood satisfaction perceptions of neighborhood change differ across racial groups. 

The study also investigates the willingness to live in \emph{other} integrated neighborhoods in the Washington, D.C.\ metropolitan area among people living in integrated neighborhoods. This latter research aim provides a glimpse into the durability of integration. All neighborhoods undergo change through people moving out of and into the neighborhood. The racial composition of people who move into the neighborhood will have to roughly represent the racial composition of the metropolitan area as a whole to maintain integration into the future. 

Previous research would suggest that white preferences play a disproportionate role in the process of maintaining integration. While people of color have expressed a desire to live in integrated neighborhoods and have moved in substantial numbers to previous all-white neighborhoods, whites neither express nor move to non-white neighborhoods in more than token numbers. Previous research has not, to date, focused either on the residents of multiethnic neighborhoods nor preferences for multiethnic neighborhoods. This study will provide the first systematic evidence regarding the long-term viability of multiracial neighborhoods across an entire metropolitan area. 

\section{Data and Methods}
\subsection{Sample}
Data for this study come from the 2016 D.C.\ Area Survey. The Washington, D.C.\ metropolitan areas, like most others in the U.S., is very segregated. Blacks and whites are groups most segregated from one another. The western side of the city is overwhelmingly white, as are the surrounding jurisdictions of Montgomery County in Maryland, and Fairfax and Arlington Counties in Virginia. Black residents in the metropolitan area disproportionately live in the eastern half of the city and in neighboring Prince George's County. 

Median household income in 2016 for the entire metropolitan area: \$95,843.

D.C.\ area residents have attained high levels of education and wealth compared to other metropolitan areas. \TK percent of residents aged 25 and older have a four year degree and \TK have a professional degree. This is true across racial groups. The D.C. area has the highest percentage of black residents, \TK\% with a four year degree of all metropolitan areas. Immigrants in the D.C.\ area are also more educated than the average metropolitan area, with \TK\ holding a four year degree and \TK\ holding a professional degree (among other large metropolitan areas \TK\ hold a four year degree and \TK\ hold a professional degree). These factors reduce the level of inequality across racial and immigration status that typify many U.S.\ metropolitan areas and produce conditions conducive to study the potential for stable integration.

The D.C.\ Area Survey sampled from a subset of the D.C.\ metropolitan area. The sample included the District of Columbia and its adjacent jurisdictions. Those are Montgomery and Prince George's Counties in Maryland, Arlington and Fairfax Counties in Virginia, and the independent city of Alexandria, Virginia.\footnote{The independent cities of Fairfax and Falls Church were included as part of Fairfax County.}  Consistent with national trends, the majority of quadrivial and disproportionately Latino neighborhoods were in the five suburban jurisdictions, not in the District of Columbia. Figure~\ref{fig:nhoodmap} shows the location of eligible neighborhoods in the D.C.\ area. 

Households were sampled for the survey using a stratified address-based sample of residents living in either a quadrivial or disproportionately Latino neighborhood. Quadrivial neighborhoods were defined as any Census tract in which blacks, Latinos, Asians, and whites each made up at least ten percent of the population based on the 2010 Census, and in which no racial group was a majority. Disproportionately Latino neighborhoods were neighborhoods that was not already classified as a quadrivial neighborhood and in which at least 25~percent of the residents identified as Latino.

Packets were mailed to 9,600 addresses in Census tracts defined as either quadrivial or disproportionately Latino neighborhoods. Strata were created within each type of neighborhood to oversample households from the address registry with Asian and Hispanic surnames as well as neighborhoods with high percentages of black residents. These strata helped ensure sufficient representation of all four racial groups to model findings by race. The sample generalizes to the population of residents living in quadrivial and disproportionately Latino neighborhoods. 

The packet mailed to households contained a two-sided cover letter written in English on one side and Spanish on the other, a questionnaire booklet, a postage-paid return envelope and a two dollar bill. Packets sent to households in the disproportionately Latino neighborhoods also included a Spanish language questionnaire. Packets were sent at the beginning of March 2016, and a reminder letter was sent two weeks later. Surveys were collected for approximately seven weeks after the initial mailing. We received 1,222 completed surveys. The response rate using AAPOR Response Rate 4 was 12.8~percent

\subsection{Dependent Variables} 
\paragraph{Neighborhood satisfaction.} I first examined how satisfied respondents report being in their neighborhood. The questionnaire asked respondents, ``How satisfied are you with your neighborhood as a place to live?'' and respondents could respond that they were extremely, very, somewhat, or not at all satisfied. For the primary analysis, I coded a dichotomous satisfaction variable with respondents who said that they were extremely or very satisfied coded as ``yes'' and those who said somewhat or not at all coded as ``no.'' 

\paragraph{Neighborhood improvement.} I examined whether respondents considered their neighborhood to be improving. Perceiving improvement in neighborhood conditions would make residents likelier to stay in the neighborhood. Measuring perceptions of improvement helps ascertain whether one racial group might view integration less favorably than others, and thus more prone to moving. 

To measure whether a respondent perceived the neighborhood improvement, the questionnaire asked, ``Looking back over the past five years or so, would you say that your neighborhood has:'' and offered the following responses: ``Become a much better place to live,'' ``Become a somewhat better place to live,'' ``Stayed about the same,'' ``Become a somewhat worse place to live,'' and ``Become a much worse place to live.'' I created a variable measuring whether a respondent perceived neighborhood improvement that was coded as ``yes'' if the respondent indicated that their neighborhood had become a much better or somewhat better place to live, and ``no'' otherwise. 

\paragraph{Preferences for other multiethnic neighborhoods.}





\subsection{Independent and Control Variables}
\paragraph{Race and ethnicity.} To test racial differences in neighborhood satisfaction, perception of improvement, and residential preferences, I used self-identified race and ethnicity as the independent variable for all analyses. Respondents were asked about Hispanic ethnicity and race separately, and respondents were allowed to indicate more than one race. The variables was recoded so that groups would be mutually exclusive. I coded as Latino and respondent who indicated \emph{Latino} ethnicity. I classified as \emph{black} anyone who responded that they were black and whom did not indicate Latino ethnicity; as \emph{Asian} anyone who responded that they were Asian or Asian-American or Pacific Islander or Native Hawaiian, and whom did not indicate Latino ethnicity; and as \emph{white} anyone who responded that they were white along and not Latino. We removed anyone else classified as ``other'' in our analysis, leaving 1,162 respondents. 

\paragraph{Control variables.} I included several control variables to control for familial and socioeconomic differences across racial groups. Demographic controls included \emph{gender} (reference=``woman''), marital status (reference=``married or in a marriage-like arrangement''), and whether the household had any children under the age of 18 living at the household. We also controlled for the respondent's age  and whether they were born outside of the United States. 

Socioeconomic controls included educational attainment and income. We asked respondents to report the highest degree that they had earned and classified responses into five categories: less than high school, a high school degree or GED, some college or a two-year degree, a bachelor's degree, and a professional degree. I made the modal category, those who earned a bachelor's degree, the reference category (to demonstrate the high levels of educational attainment in the D.C.\ area, 29~percent of respondents reported a professional degree). Income was classified into four categories: less than \$40,000, \$40,000 to less than \$75,000, \$75,000 to less than \$150,000, and \$150,000 or more. I set \$75,000 to less than \$150,000, the modal category, as the reference. 

Finally, I included three variables to control for the respondent's experience with the neighborhood that could influence their perceptions of the neighborhood. I controlled for the number of years a respondent lived in the neighborhood. I also included a control for the respondents' reported size of their neighborhood. I classified responses into three categories: one for those who said their neighborhood was one to nine blocks, one for those that said their neighborhood was ten to fifty blocks, and one for those that said their neighborhood was larger than fifty blocks. Third, I included a control to measure whether the respondent lived in a quadrivial neighborhood (compared to a disproportionately Latino neighborhood). Table~\ref{tab:descriptives} reports the un-weighted descriptive statistics of the independent and control variables. 

\abouthere{Table}{tab:descriptives}

\subsection{Method}
I used logistic regressions to analyze each of the outcomes. Because the data were collected using a complex survey sample design, survey weights were applied to all analyses to reduce bias in the estimates. In addition, there were large proportions of missing data on several variables. I used multiple imputation to account for missingness. All reported coefficients, therefore, account for both survey design and missing data. I used R version 3.5.0 with the \texttt{survey} to account for sample design and \texttt{Amelia} library to account for missing data \needcite. All code for this analysis is available through a replication package available at \TK.

I centered all covariates except for race around their means. Centering facilitated the interpretation of race in the model because the base (logged) odds represented the mean white respondent in the survey.As a result the race coefficients were compared to one another at the conditional grand mean of survey. 

\section{Results}
\subsection{Neighborhood Satisfaction}
Overall, 68~percent of residents were satisfied with their neighborhoods: 70~percent in quadrivial neighborhoods and 66~percent in disproportionately Latino neighborhoods. Figure~\ref{fig:satisfaction} show that neighborhood evaluations were remarkably similar across the four racial groups: fewer than two percentage points separate the group with the highest reported satisfaction (Latinos) from the group with the lowest (Asians). 

\abouthere{Figure}{fig:satisfaction}

Table~\ref{tab:satisfaction} reports estimates of a series of models predicting neighborhood satisfaction. The baseline model includes only race and replicates the results of Figure~\ref{fig:satisfaction}. The coefficients changed very little after adding the demographic and socioeconomic variables to the model, which can be seen in the second column. Adding controls measuring residents' neighborhood experience, reported in column three, also did not affect the consistency in satisfaction across neighborhoods. Among the controls, only the resident's perception of the size of their neighborhood was associated with satisfaction. Residents who perceived their neighborhood to consist of one to nine blocks were half as likely to be satisfied with their neighborhood compared to residents whose perceived neighborhoods were 10 to 50 blocks. None of the demographic and socioeconomic controls were associated with neighborhood satisfaction at a level statistically distinguishable from having no influence. 

\abouthere{Table}{tab:satisfaction}

I also examined whether the intensity of satisfaction varied by racial group. To do this, I conducted the same analysis but changed the outcome to be include as satisfied only respondents who were \emph{extremely satisfied} in their neighborhood. Twenty-eight percent of whites reported being extremely satisfied with their neighborhood, a value one-and-a-half to almost two times as high as other racial groups, though the differences could not be statistically distinguished from the null (results available in supplement). 

\subsection{Neighborhood Improvement}
The first analysis revealed that residents of all racial groups experience satisfaction in their neighborhoods at similar rates to one another. The small distinction that existed showed whites being more extremely satisfied compared to people of color. The next analysis examined whether racial groups perceived changes in the neighborhood to be in the same direction. 

The left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:improvement} shows the percentage of respondents who identified as each racial group who thought that their neighborhoods had gotten somewhat or much better. Whites and blacks were slightly less likely than Asians and Latinos to say that neighborhoods have improved, but the magnitudes of differences are very small. Table~\ref{tab:improvement} confirms the lack of differences between racial groups in perceiving neighborhood improvement, even after adding controls for demographic, socioeconomic, and neighborhood experience variables. Among the control variables, men were more likely than women to have perceived improvement, while residents who attained a professional degree, those who viewed a small area as their neighborhood, and those who lived in the neighborhood longer all were less likely to have perceived neighborhood improvement. 

\abouthere{Table}{tab:improvement}

Although perceptions of improvement did not vary by race, the intensity with which residents perceived improvement did. The right side of Figure~\ref{fig:improvement} shows that whites reported a lower intensity of improvements compared to people of color. that whites were far less likely to indicate that neighborhoods have gotten ``much better.'' Only eight percent of white respondents perceived their neighborhoods to have gotten much better, compared to seventeen percent of Asians and blacks and nineteen percent of Latinos. 

\abouthere{Figure}{fig:improvement}

Table~\ref{tab:muchbetter} shows that the racial differences could not be explained by demographic, socioeconomic, or neighborhood experience factors. Controlling for just demographic and socioeconomic characteristics reduced the differences of Asians and Latinos from whites, though the former was a small change in magnitude. All three coefficients for racial groups become substantially larger after adding in controls for neighborhood experience. Asians, Latinos, and Blacks were each approximately three times more likely to report substantial improvement compared to whites. 

\abouthere{Table}{tab:muchbetter}

It appears that some of the intensity might resulted from whites being more likely to be extremely satisfied in their neighborhoods. As I described above, whites were more likely to say they had extreme satisfaction in their neighborhood than other groups. It's possible that white respondents would report less improvement because they already perceived the neighborhood as being an extremely satisfying place to live. The model shows the inverse: improvement was more strongly associated with extreme satisfaction and racial disparities increased after controlling for the intensity of satisfaction. 

\subsection{Preferences for Multiethnic Neighborhoods}
The analyses above found few racial differences present in multiethnic neighborhoods where people \emph{currently} live. Maintaining multiethnic integration \emph{in the future}, however, requires that residents of all races consider moving to integrated neighborhoods. Differential probabilities of considering neighborhoods across races will lead to segregation in the long term \citep{bader_fragmented_2016, krysan_cycle_2017}.

The 2016 DCAS asked respondents a series of five questions about eleven communities in the Washington, D.C.\ area. Two of those questions were whether the respondent would ``\emph{seriously} consider moving to the community'' and ``\emph{never} consider moving to the community.'' The two questions get at two different phases of the search process, the initial phase of looking for a home and a subsequent phase when people might eliminate potential communities to make the choice more manageable \textbf{CITE: BRUCH, KRYSAN \& CROWDER, BADER \& KRYSAN}. 

The eleven communities were chosen because they all represented communities similarly diverse to the neighborhoods in which the respondents currently lived. The communities were also chosen to represent different geographic areas, with two communities in the District, five in suburban Maryland, and four in suburban Virginia. I classify four of the communities as disproportionately Latino: both of the communities in the District (Columbia Heights and Brightwood) and two in Prince George's County, Maryland (Hyattsville and Langley Park). All of the quadirivial neighborhoods were in the suburbs: Greenbelt, Wheaton, and Germantown, Maryland; and Arlington, Annandale, Huntington, and Herndon, Virginia. Although some of the communities as a whole do not meet the benchmark of 10 percent racial composition of each of the four groups, all contain census tracts defined as quadrivial neighborhoods. Table~\ref{tab:communities} reports the racial composition, median income and housing value, and poverty rate in each of the communities and Figure~\ref{fig:map} maps the communities. The communities are also described in some more detail in the supplemental appendix.

\subsection{Description of Selectable Communities}
\textbf{Disproportionately Latino Communities.} The four disproportionately Latino neighborhoods were all in the District and Prince George's County, Maryland. In the District,  \emph{Columbia Heights} is a gentrified neighborhood which was devastated as part of the 1968 riots in Washington, D.C.\ that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. The neighborhood is now about a third white, a third black, and a quarter Latino. \emph{Brightwood} is just under three miles to the north of Columbia Heights (i.e., farther from downtown) and has traditionally been a middle-class black neighborhood. Black residents still make up fifty percent of residents, but a growing non-black population has increased such that whites make up 20 percent of the neighborhood and Latinos make up 25 percent. 

\emph{Hyattsville} sits less than a mile northeast from the District in Prince George's County, Maryland has developed a reputation of an attractive community for artists in recent years. Blacks and Latinos each make up about a third of residents, white residents make up just under a quarter, and Asians under five percent of residents. \emph{Langley Park}, which sits to the northeast of Hyattsville, represents the largest percentage of Latinos in the Washington, D.C.\ area: over four in five residents of Langley Park identifies as Latino. One in eight residents is black while whites and Asians make up less than five percent of the population combined. 

\textbf{Quadrivial Communities.} The seven communities classified as quadrivial communities were all in the suburbs outside of the District. 

In Prince George's County, \emph{Greenbelt} was developed as a housing cooperative project by the federal government during the New Deal that initially screened residents and denied residence to people of color. Black residents now make up half of the population, whites a quarter, Latinos 15 percent, and Asians eight percent. \emph{Wheaton} is a suburb that sits two miles directly north of the District's northernmost point in Montgomery County, Maryland. It has been home to both Latino and Asian immigrants, as is reflected in its racial composition: 41 percent of residents identify as Latino and 13 percent identify as Asian. Whites make up just under a quarter of residents and blacks make up just under one in five. \emph{Germantown} is fourteen miles to the northwest of Wheaton has developed since the 1980s and is the most diverse of the eleven communities. Blacks, Latinos, and Asians compose 20 percent of residents each and whites make up about one third of residents. 

\emph{Annandale}, which is seven miles to the southwest of the District in Fairfax County, Virginia, has attracted Asian immigrants, particularly from Vietnam and Korea. Asians make up a quarter of residents, Latinos make up 30 percent, whites make up 36 percent, and blacks only 7 percent. \emph{Huntington} is on the eastern edge of Fairfax County, and despite being eleven miles to the south of the District, has easy access to the region as it is the terminus of one of the subway lines and sits on the Virginia side of the Potomac River crossing of the Capital Beltway. Half of the residents are white, just under a quarter are Latino, 17 percent are black and 8 percent are Asian. \emph{Herndon} sits on the other side of Fairfax County near Dulles Airport, fourteen miles to the west of the District. It has experienced rapid growth related to government contracting. Approximately a third of residents are white and another third are Latino while Asians make up 17 percent and blacks 10 percent of residents. 

\emph{Arlington}, Virginia was the final community included on the map and differs from the others because it is both a city and county. It was the largest of the communities included on the map and has experienced gentrification throughout the jurisdiction, in part due to its proximity to the District.\footnote{Arlington County was, in fact, one of two counties in the District of Columbia. The county, originally called Alexandria County, was retroceded to the state of Virginia a decade and a half before the Civil War over its support for slavery.} The median income of \$106,000--ten thousand dollars over the median income of the Washington metro area--makes it one of the wealthiest counties in America. Nearly two-thirds of residents are white, 15 percent are Latino, 10 percent are Asian, and 8 percent are black.
