\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Multiethnic neighborhoods have emerged as a common feature in U.S.
metropolitan areas during the past half century. Federal
anti-discrimination laws, changing racial attitudes, and increased
immigration created new opportunities for people to become neighbors
with people across multiple racial and ethnic categories. Once
exceptional, racial integration among the four largest racial and ethnic
groups in the United States has become one of the most common forms--and
in some metropolitan areas, \emph{the} most common form--of neighborhood
racial change since the 1970s and 1980s \textbf{{[}cite: Logan \& Zhang;
Bader \& Warkentien{]}}. In a nation beset by its history of racial
discrimination and resulting segregation, multiethnic neighborhoods
offer hope for a more integrated future.

Academic research has not kept pace with the growing presence of
multiethnically integrated neighborhoods in American metropolitan areas.
A small body of qualitative works studying the unique dynamics of
integrated neighborhoods provides valuable insight\textbf{{[}w.ch{]}}
into the dynamics of racial integration. But research on neighborhood
gentrification and the concentration of poverty has dwarfed that which
focuses on this emergent form of neighborhood change. \textbf{{[}Focus
on theory, not policy{]}: Without systematic research on multiethnic
neighborhoods, any predictions about the sustainability of this newfound
integration will be imprecise and insufficient to inform policies to
maintain multiethnic integration.}

To help build the body of evidence on multiethnic neighborhoods, this
article examines whether residents of all races feel equally satisfied
living in multiethnic neighborhoods. It does so among a representative
sample of residents living in multiethnic neighborhoods in the
Washington, D.C. area, a major metropolitan area in the United States
with a large number of multiethnic neighborhoods. Evidence from the
sample shows that satisfaction is quite high, and that whites are
similarly satisfied living in multiethnic neighborhoods as their Asian,
black, and Latino neighbors. The findings also show, however, mixed
evidence that multiethnic segregation will remain sustainable in the
future as the neighborhoods continue to change. The findings reveal
directions of future research and possible policy intervention that
might be necessary to understand and promote racial integration in the
coming decades.

\section{Background}\label{background}

Multiethnic neighborhoods came about as Asian, black, and Latinx
newcomers moved into neighborhoods that had been all white, or nearly
so, starting in the 1980s \textbf{(cite: Logan; Bader)}. The trend
accelerated in the 1990s and 2000s. Unlike past decades where the entry
of non-white residents sparked violence and white flight that caused
racial transitions, many whites stayed put as their neighborhoods
integrated around them. The number of neighborhoods shared among white,
Asian, black, and Latinx neighbors rose rapidly in the 1990s and 2000s.
Logan and Zhang estimate that \textbf{TK\%} of neighborhoods in 2010
were what they termed ``global neighborhoods.'' Similarly, Bader and
Warkentien found stable multiethnic integration represented between
\textbf{TK\%} and \textbf{TK\%} of neighborhoods in the metropolitan
areas of the four largest cities.

Several currents made the growth of multiethnic neighborhoods possible.
Federal legislation, especially the Fair Housing Act, made housing
discrimination a federal crime. The impact of the FHA, which was passed
in 1968 in the wake of the Rev.~Dr.~Martin Luther King, Jr.'s
assassination, was neither immediate nor universal. Racial
discrimination has persisted in more subtle ways such as real-estate
agents ``steering'' clients to neighborhoods. The FHA provided, however,
provided a legal mechanism for people of color to enter white
neighborhoods and challenge overt forms of discrimination.

Second, \emph{multiethnic} integration would be impossble without a
multiethnic population. Increased immigration from Asian and Latin
American countries increased the number of Asian and Latinx people in
the United States. Immigration unsettled the stark black-white divide in
many American metropolitan areas. The trend\textbf{{[}w.ch{]}} was most
pronounced in metropolitan areas that became ``new immigrant''
destinations in the 1980s and 1990s. The growing economies that
attracted migrants also required new housing construction to accomodate
growing populations that made integrated neighborhoods possible from the
get-go\textbf{{[}w.ch.{]}}.

Finally, racial attitudes have been changing.

\subsection{Satisfaction and Long-Term
Stability}\label{satisfaction-and-long-term-stability}

\subsubsection{Satisfaction and
Mobility}\label{satisfaction-and-mobility}

Neighborhood satisfaction influences whether people stay put in their
neighborhoods. The process of white flight can be described as whites
having acted on the immediate and strong feelings of dissatisfaction
that the entry of a black family prompted. As whites vacated their
houses, additional black families--who were dissatisfied being forced to
live in overcrowded ghettos through law and custom--filled those
vacancies. The process resulted in the rapid ``succession'' of the
neighborhood's composition from all-white to all-black.

The more sanguine attitudes whites hold about people of color could mean
that whites are now satisfied living in integrated neighborhoods. If so,
then there is a stronger prospect of long-term integration. Evidence is
mixed. On the one hand, patterns of neighborhood change seem to bear
this out, with little evidence of rapid racial succession since the
1980s. On the other, studies consistently show lower levels of
satisfaction among whites who live in neighborhoods in which people of
color make up an increasing share of their neighbors.

Existing studies of satisfaction among residents measure the composition
of racial groups separately or measure the composition of all non-white
residents grouped into a single category. \textbf{{[}cite findings
here{]}} Multiethnic neighborhoods represent a distinctive form of
integration not captured by the method of measuring racial compositions
of groups. Instead, the \emph{presence} of all four racial groups
distinguishes these neighborhoods and satisfaction among residents of
different races in these distinctive neighborhoods have not been
measured.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Are groups equally satisifed living in integrated neighborhoods, and
  therefore likely to stay (maintaining integration)?
\end{itemize}

Measuring whether residents think that the neighborhood has improved
provides an additional measure of satisfaction. While satisfied
residents might not feel compelled to leave, they could be more inclined
to leave if they perceive less improvement in the neighborhood. Previous
research shows that white perceptions of neighborhood trends diminish
with increasing non-white composition. Even if whites feel satisfied
living in neighborhoods, they might feel less confident that they will
be satisfied in the future. If true, then whites might be enticed to
leave the neighborhood more readily than neighbors of color. Again,
however, existing studies do not sample \emph{multiethnic}
neighborhoods.

\subsubsection{Long-Term Stability}\label{long-term-stability}

Even residents satisfied living in their neighborhood will find
themselves exiting for reasons unrelated to the racial composition of
the neighborhood. Residents will get married, retire, have children, get
divorced, and, in the most extreme case, exit upon their death. Life
course transitions such as these cause most moves; and, as residents
move out for those reasons, new residents will move in. Satisfaction
will be insufficient to predict future integration because integration
will survive only as long as the current cohort of residents does. To
maintain the multiethnic diversity of the neighborhood therefore
requires that the racial composition of households \emph{leaving}
multiethnic neighborhoods approximates the racial composition of those
\emph{entering} multiethnic neighborhoods.

Multiethnic neighborhoods must attract racially diverse newcomers to
maintain integration. Residents currently residing in multiethnic
neighborhoods provide an obvious clientele to fill vacancies in
multiethnic neighborhoods. Yet, we have neither a sense whether current
residents of multiethnic neighborhoods would consider moving to another
multiethnic neighborhood, nor whether the proportion who would consider
another multiethnic neighborhood differs across racial groups.

Rather than being individually derived or collectively negotiated within
households, housing preferences reflect a deeply social process.
Households cannot engage with the housing market across an entire
metropolitan area. Krysan and Crowder show that people approach housing
searches based on word of mouth that shape what people think about
different communities, and whether they even know anything about the
community at all. Settling on which neighborhoods to consider--and which
not to waste time considering--reflects social networks that are
segregated by race. Differences in the knowledge residents use as
starting points for their housing searches can help us predict the
future stability of multiethnic integration.

Race influences the familiarity residents have with communities and
where residents consider moving. Whites know more about and desire
moving to neighborhoods with larger shares of white residents. Whites
differ from other racial groups, who have stronger desires for
integration than whites. Havekes and colleagues find that racial
composition influences white searches more at each stage of the search
process. They find that whites move to communities with lower shares of
whites on average than communities that they search which, in turn, have
lower shares of whites on average than communities whites report
considering. Multiethnic neighborhoods might expose white residents to
more diverse social networks and increase the probability that whites
would consider another multiethnic neighborhood. But, again, we have no
evidence one way or the other among residents living in multiethnic
neighborhoods.

\subsubsection{Hypotheses}\label{hypotheses}

In light of this evidence, this article examines two hypotheses:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Whites living in multiethnic neighborhoods will be a) less satisfied
  with their neighborhoods and b) less likely to perceive neighborhood
  improvement compared to their Asian, black, and Latinx neighbors; and
\item
  Whites living in multiethnic neighborhoods will be will be a) less
  familiar with, b) less likely to consider, and c) more likely to never
  consider moving to other multiethnic neighborhoods in their
  metropolitan area compared to their Asian, black, and Latinx
  neighbors.
\end{enumerate}

\section{\textless{}\textless{}\textgreater{}\textgreater{}}\label{section}

\subsection{Multiethnic Neighborhoods in the Washington, D.C.
Area}\label{multiethnic-neighborhoods-in-the-washington-d.c.-area}

Data to test the hypotheses come from the 2016 DC Area Survey (DCAS).
Washington, D.C. has historically been a segregated metropolitan area.
Almost all blacks lived in the eastern part of the city and nearly all
whites in the west. This east-west pattern spilled out to the Maryland
suburbs. Few blacks lived across the Potomac River in Northern Virginia,
though they were highly clustered in a small number of neighborhoods. In
1970, only \textbf{TK}\% and \textbf{TK}\% of Asians and Latinxs lived
in the DC area.

The region's economy grew and became less based on the federal
government in the 1980s and 1990. The expansion of finance, insurance,
and real estate services, collectively known by the acronym FIRE,
mirrored the sector's prominence in redeveloping metropolitan areas in
the U.S. and abroad. During the same period, the region emerged as an
immigrant destination. As the nation's capital and importance in
international relations, the region's foreign-born residents are more
socioeconomically diverse than average. Latinos and Asians now comprise
\textbf{TK}\% and \textbf{TK}\%, respectively, of the DC area while
blacks make up \textbf{TK}\% and whites \textbf{TK}\%. \textbf{TK}
residents were born outside of the United States, with the largest
shares coming from El Salvador, \textbf{TK}, and \textbf{TK}.

Real estate developers capitalized on the expanding population by
developing large swaths of land in middle-ring suburbs in the counties
surrounding the District. Having been built after the Fair Housing Act
passed, the residences developed in these suburbs were not subject to
the history of redlining restrictive covenants of previous developments.
Residents of all races were attracted to these new suburban homes,
especially in Montgomery and Fairfax Counties that boasted nationally
renowned school systems. As Figure \textbf{TK} shows, multiethnic
neighborhoods were especially likely to emerge along the hub-and-spoke
system of the region's commuter rail lines. Additionally, Montgomery
County has, since 1974, mandated that all housing developments larger
than 20 units include a set percentage of units that qualify as
affordable housing.\footnote{Fairfax County passed an inclusionary
  zoning ordinance in 1971, but it was struck down by the Virginia
  Supreme Court. Fairfax County implemented a different mandatory
  inclusionary zoning policy in 1990.}

The 2016 DCAS sought to represent residents of two types of
neighborhoods--multiethnic and disproportionately Latinx--in the
Washington, D.C. area, which comprised Washington, D.C. and the
surrounding jurisdictions of Montgomery and Prince George's Counties in
Maryland, Arlington and Fairfax (including the cities of Falls Church
and Fairfax) Counties Virginia, and the independent city of Alexandria,
Virginia. Only responses from residents sampled in the multiethnic
neighborhoods were included in this analysis.\footnote{Disproportionately
  Latinx neighborhoods were those in which Latinx residents made up at
  least a quarter of the residents and were not already classified as a
  multiethnic neighborhood.}

Multiethnic neighborhoods included in the sampling frame met two
criteria. First, Asians, blacks, Latinxs, and whites each comprised at
least 10\textasciitilde{}percent of the population of the neighborhood.
This cutoff was used to ensure that each of the four racial groups
represented a distinguishable subset of a neighborhood's residents.
Second, none of those four groups could represent a majority of
residents. This criterion was included to eliminate neighborhoods where
a single group formed the dominant identity of the neighborhood. These
criteria resulted in a sample frame of 114 neighborhoods that
represented \textbf{TK} people. The majority of neighborhoods were in
Montgomery County, Maryland, followed by Fairfax County, Virginia, then
\textbf{TK}\ldots{} The neighborhoods included in the sampling frame are
shown in Figure @ref(fig:map). An address-based sample of households was
drawn from these eligible neighborhoods that included oversamples of
households with Asian and Hispanic surnames and households located in
from disproportionately black tracts (that still satisfied the criteria
as multiethnic neighborhoods).

{[}Figure @ref(fig:map) about here{]}

Table @ref(tab:nhddescriptives) contains a comparison of multiethnic
neighborhoods to all neighborhoods in the DC area. Whites make up about
a third of multiethnic neighborhoods, on average, while Latinxs make up
about a quarter. Blacks and Asians make up 22 and 18 percent of
residents, respectively.

{[}Table @ref(tab:nhddescriptives) about here{]}

Immigration represented the largest deviation of multiethnic
neighborhoods from DC area neighborhoods overall. Immigrants make up
nearly two of every five residents in multiethnic neighborhoods,
compared to just under one of every four residents in neighborhoods
overall. Residents of multiethnic neighborhoods had slightly lower
educational attainment than neighborhoods overall. One in four residents
of multiethnic neighborhoods, however, had a bachelor's degree and one
in five had a post-graduate degree. Married households and those with
children comprised a larger share of households in multiethnic
neighborhoods compared to DC area neighborhoods overall.

Eighteen neighborhoods met the first inclusion criterion but not the
second. Of those eighteen, fifteen were neighborhoods that had a white
majority; six were located in Fairfax County, Virginia (including one in
Fairfax city), five in Montgomery County, Maryland, and two each in D.C.
and Arlington County, Virginia. Two neighborhoods had a black majority,
one each in Montgomery County and Prince George's County, and only one
neighborhood, in Montgomery County, had a Latinx majority.

A 12-page survey booklet was mailed to 9,600 households in those two
types of neighborhoods along with a one-page cover letter written in
English and Spanish on opposite sides, a two-dollar bill as an
incentive, and a postage-paid return envelope. A reminder was sent to
all households that had not responded approximately two weeks after the
original survey was sent. By the end of the 54-day field period, 1,222
households responded with complete surveys, 674 of which were from
households in multiethnic neighborhoods. The responses from the entire
sample represeted a 12.8 percent response rate (AAPOR RR4 standard).

\subsection{Dependent Variables}\label{dependent-variables}

The analyses use dichotomous measures of satisfaction and neighborhood
improvement as dependent variables. To measure current neighborhood
\emph{satisfaction}, respondents who indicated that they were
``extremely'' or ``very'' satisfied living in their neighborhood were
coded as being satisfied. Those who indicated that they were
``somewhat'' or ``not at all'' satisfied were coded as being
unsatisfied.

The measure of neighborhood improvement was taken from the respondents'
answers to the question, ``Looking back over the past five years or so,
would you say that your neighborhood has\(\ldots\)'' I coded respondents
as having indicated that their neighborhood improved if they answered
that their neighborhood has become a ``much better'' or ``somewhat
better'' place to live. Respondents coded as not perceiving neighborhood
improvement were those who answered that their neighborhoods ``about the
same,'' ``somewhat worse,'' or ``much worse.''

\subsection{Independent Variable}\label{independent-variable}

A measure created from respondents' self-identified race and ethnicity
is the independent variable in all analyses. Respondents were allowed to
pick multiple racial categories and indicate if they identified as
Latinx. I collapsed these two variables to create four categories:
\emph{Latinx} for those of any race who identified as Latinx;
\emph{white} for those who identified only as white; \emph{black} for
those who non-Latinx respondents who identified as black, either alone
or in combination with any other race; and \emph{Asian} for those
non-Latinx respondents who identified as either Asian or Pacific
Islander, either alone or in combination with any other race other than
black. Respondents missing on either the race or ethnicity question and
respondents who identified with other racial groups were not included in
the analysis. This left a final analytic dataset of \{N\} respondents.

\subsection{Control Variables}\label{control-variables}

In addition to racial variables, I also included variables to control
for other demographic characteristics of residents. I calculated
\emph{age} based on respondents' birth year and \emph{gender} based on
respondents' gender identity, for which they were given the choices
``male,'' ``female,'' and ``other.'' Male was set as the reference. Only
two respondents chose ``other'' and were coded as missing. I included an
indicator for \emph{being partnered} based on those respondents who
indicated that they were ``now married or in a marriage-style
arrangment,'' with those not currently partnered as the reference.

I included whether the respondent had \emph{children in the household}
because the presence of children would likely affect the outlook
residents have of their neighborhoods. The question did not limit the
response to respondents' own children. I also included an indicator to
measure whether respondents were \emph{foreign born} since immigrant
status would likely correlate with residential perceptions and race
simultaneously.

I represented economic status with a measure of \emph{educational
attainment}. I created a measure with five categories based on the
highest level of education respondents reported: less than high school,
high school (including GED), some college (including associates
degrees), bachelors degree, and graduate degree. I chose to use
educational attainment to measure socioeconomic status because it is a
more stable measure than income, and space did not permit the DCAS to
ascertain income longitudinally. Income also had more missing data
compared to educational attainment (N=\{miinc\}) instead of
(N=\{mieduc\}). Among those respondents who answered both questions,
however, education and income were highly correlated.

In addition to demographic characteristics, I also included controls for
the respondent's experience in the neighborhood. First, I included the
\emph{years respondents lived in their neighborhoods} since the length
of time lived in neighborhoods could affect perceptions of quality and
would certainly affect perceptions of neighborhood change. Second, I
included a measure of \emph{neighborhood size}. This measure was
self-reported by respondents and including it in models accounts for how
subjective perceptions of neighborhood boundaries affect satisfaction
and perceived change.

\section{\textless{}\textless{}\textgreater{}\textgreater{}}\label{section-1}

\subsection{Summary}\label{summary}

The 2016 DCAS data contain the elements required to test the hypotheses
stated above. The data represent the whole of residents of multiethnic
neighborhoods in a metropolitan sample. The data also provide sufficient
power to compare the responses of all four racial groups to one another
due to the oversamples. The questions used to measure satisfaction and
improvement come from previous surveys and allow for the direct
comparison of responses to the existing literature. Together, these
attributes overcome problems with previous data sources to investigate
interracial differences in multiethnic neighborhoods.

\section{Analytical Approach}\label{analytical-approach}

I used logistic regression analysis to test the hypotheses above. The
general model estimated can be expressed as:

\[\mathbf{y} = \alpha + \mathbf{\beta^T X} + \mathbf{\gamma^T Z} + \mathbf{\delta_j} + \mathbf{\epsilon}\]

\noindent where \(\mathbf{y}\) is the vector of outcomes for
respondents, \(\alpha\) is the intercept, \(\mathbf{\beta}\) is a vector
of point estimates for racial groups (with whites omitted),
\(\mathbf{X}\), and \(\mathbf{\epsilon}\) is a vector of
individual-specific errors. Non-Latinx whites were the reference group
since the hypotheses ask whether whites differ from other groups. The
vector \(\mathbf{\gamma}\) contains point estimates of demographic and
neighborhood experience controls, \(\mathbf{Z}\). I first estimated each
outcome with only the intercept and race terms included. I then
estimated each outcome with controls present. I conducted all analyses
in R version \Rversion.

All models included a fixed effect, \(\mathbf{\delta_j}\), for the
neighborhood of residence. Neighborhoods were defined as residents'
census tracts. Including neighborhood fixed effects makes the estimates,
\(\mathbf{\beta}\), reflect the differences between white outcomes and
those of Asians, blacks, and Latinxs \emph{living in the same
neighborhood}. Respondents who lived in neighborhoods without other
respondents (N=\oneresp) were removed from the analysis. The remaining
respondents lived in tracts with a median of \medNpertract and a maximum
of \maxNpertract.

All analyses accounted for missing data and the complex survey design. I
used the \texttt{Amelia} package (cite) to impute missing values in five
datasets. I conducted all analyses using these five datasets weighting
outcomes to account for the complex sample design using the
\texttt{survey} library. I combined all results using Rubin's rules
{[}TK:cite{]}. All code for the models presented here are available at
{[}redacted{]}.

\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsection{Satisfication Living in Multiethnic
Neighborhoods}\label{satisfication-living-in-multiethnic-neighborhoods}

Most residents of multiethnic neighborhoods, \meansatisfied percent, are
satisfied living in their neighborhood. Satisfaction was equally high
among all four racial groups: \apisatisfied percent of Asians,
\hspsatisfied percent of Latinxs, \nhbsatisfied percent of blacks, and
\nhwsatisfied percent of whites in the sample were either ``extremely''
or ``very'' satisfied living in their multiethnic neighborhoods.

The agreement across racial groups held when I statistically compared
groups within the same neighborhoods by modeling satisfaction with
neighborhood fixed effects. The first column of Table
@ref(tab:satisfaction) reports the results of a model including only
respondent race and neighborhood fixed effects. The estimates for racial
groups are small and not distinguishable from zero.

{[}Table @ref(tab:satisfaction) about here{]}

To further show the lack of difference between racial groups, I plotted
the predicted probability from the model in the left panel of Figure
@ref(fig:satisfaction). The plotted figures represent the predicted
probability in the neighborhood with median satisfaction in the data,
and reflect the estimates predicted across the five imputed data sets
combined using Rubin's rules \textbf{{[}need cite{]}}. \textbf{{[}Look
into replacing this estimate with the AME{]}} Only \maxdiffone percent
separated the most satisfied group (Latinxs) from the least satisfied
(Asians).

{[}Figure @ref(fig:satisfaction) about here{]}

The second column of Table @ref(tab:satisfaction) further confirmed that
satisfaction was an interracial sentiment among residents of multiethnic
neighborhoods. The estimates were again small and could not be
distinguished from a null effect. The right panel of Figure
@ref\{fig:satisfaction\} shows the predicted probabilities of
satisfaction from the model with controls. I estimated the probabilities
and standard errors at the reference level for all other variables in
the model, meaning the figure represents the satisfaction of a
50-year-old, native-born, unmarried woman with a high school degree and
no children who has lived in her neighborhood for 10 years.
\textbf{{[}Look into replacing this estimate with the AME{]}} In the
complete model, only \maxdiffthree separated the least satisfied group (now
whites) from the most satisfied (still Latinxs).

Not only are individual coefficients not large or statistically
singificant, but including race does not improve the explanatory power
of the model. The final column of Table @ref(tab:satisfaction) reports
the results of model estimating satisfaction in which I did not include
race. The bottom row of the table reports the Akaike information
criterion (AIC), a measure that balances a model's parsimony with its
goodness of fit to the data \textbf{{[}need cite{]}}. A lower AIC
represents a better fit to the data, and we can observe from Table
@ref(tab:satisfaction) that the model without race fits the data better
than the model that includes race. I further affirmed the lack of
explanatory power attributable to race by conducting Wald's F-test
between the models with and without race. The mean value of the test
across the imputed data sets was \satWaldF, and the p-values ranged from
\satWaldpMin to \satWaldpMax.

These results establish that residents are satisfied living in
multiethnic neighborhoods regardless of their own race. Two other
factors, education and the perceived size of the neighborhood, are
associated with neighborhood satisfaction rather than race. Education
had a curvilinear relationship with satisfaction among multiethnic
neighborhood residents. Residents of multiethnic neighborhoods with a
high school degree were the most satisfied, while residents with less
than a high school education and those with a postgraduate degree felt
satisfaction the least often. The perceived size of the neighborhood
also mattered, as those residents who thought their neighborhood
comprised 10-50 blocks were \satnhdsize times more likely to be
satisfied than those who perceived their neighborhood to be only one to
nine blocks. \textbf{{[}Connect back to idea that this is a sufficient
size to avoid the worst of microsegregation, so people are actually
satisfied with their neighborhood with multiracial composition.{]}}

\section{\textless{}\textless{}\textgreater{}\textgreater{}}\label{section-2}

While seven in ten residents of multiethnic neighborhoods were
satisfied, half that number (\meanimproved \%) thought that their
neighborhood had become a ``much better'' or ``somewhat better'' place
to live over the past five years. Also unlike satisfaction, the
probability that residents perceived improvements varied by race.
Thirty-eight percent of Asian and Latinx residents, and 35 percent of
black residents, felt that their neighborhoods had improved, while only
27 percent of whites felt that way.

The first column of Table @ref(tab:improvement) shows that the racial
differences were unlikely due to the randomness of the sample. The
results show a strong association between perceived improvement and
race: whites were much less likely than Asian, black, or Latinx
residents to believe that their neighborhoods had improved. The left
panel of Figure @ref(fig:improvement) shows the lower probability at
which whites were predicted to report improvement in multiethnic
neighborhoods than the probabilities at which people of color were
predicted to report improvement. \textbf{{[}Look into replacing this
estimate with the AME{]}}

{[}Table @ref(tab:improvement) about here{]}

The lower propensity of whites to report improvement in multiethnic
neighborhoods persisted after including controls. The second column of
Table @ref(tab:improvement) shows positive associations for all three
non-white racial groups. Asians were \apibetter~times more likely to
report improvement in their neighborhood, blacks were \nhbbetter~times
more likely, and Latinos were \hspbetter~times more likely. The latter
two differences were large enough to be confident that the difference
was not due to sampling variation at the p=0.05 level. The right panel
of Figure \ref(fig:improvement) shows the predicted probabilities of
reporting neighborhood improvement across racial groups. \textbf{{[}Look
into replacing this estimate with the AME{]}}

{[}Figure @ref(fig:improvement) about here{]}

In addition to the differences between whites and people of color in the
outcome, the model that included race fit the data better than the model
that did not. The third column of Table @ref(tab:improvement) reports
coefficient estimates and standard errors of the model without race and
shows that the AIC value increases (fits less well) between the full
model and the model without race. Wald F-tests of including race versus
not provided evidence in the same direction: the mean value of the tests
across imputed data sets was \betWaldF~and the mean p-value was
\betWaldp.

In summary, a lower proportion of whites perceived improvement in
multiethnic neighborhoods than their neighbors of color. Whites,
therefore, might be satisfied living in their multiethnic neighborhood,
but not inclined to see their neighborhood being a better place to live
in the future. Neighborhood racial diversity would have been growing in
the time period whites perceived less improvement than their neighbors.
The present study provides insufficient evidence to conclude that
increasing diversity \emph{caused} whites to perceive less improvement
than their neighbors, but it does indicate\textbf{{[}w.ch{]}} a temporal
correlation between growing diversity and a lower white endorsement of
neighborhood change.

Projecting forward, too, the less positive trajectory whites perceive
could portend a future in which whites might be more inclined, on the
margin, to move out of the neighborhood than their non-white neighbors.
Such marginal differences combined with the high rates of satisfaction
among whites would be unlikely to instigate white flight, but the higher
probability of losing white households could increase the chances of
long-term racial turnover. The chances of long-term turnover would
increase further if multiethnic neighborhoods attracted people of color
at higher rates than whites.

\section{Familiarity with and Preferences for Other Multiethnic
Places}\label{familiarity-with-and-preferences-for-other-multiethnic-places}

The long-term stability of multiethnic neighborhoods requires that
residents of all races consider moving to existing multiethnic
neighborhoods. The subsequent analyses assess how likely residents are
to consider neighborhoods and how likely they are to actively not
consider multiethnic neighborhoods.

\subsection{Familiarity with Multiethnic
Places}\label{familiarity-with-multiethnic-places}

Two measures of familiarity with other multiethnic places in the
Washington, D.C. area:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Whether the respondent reports knowing anything about the place
\item
  Whether respondent reports having friends or family in the place
\end{enumerate}

Uses the same analytical strategy, except that we add two covariates to
each model:

\item
  Whether the respondent reports living in the place

\item
  Was left with the question, so what? Bring out that this fits with my
  research showing that white acceptance of non-white neighbors is
  insufficient, they need to seek diverse neighborhoods for integration
  to persist
\item
  I am selecting on people who stayed, so these would be the whites
  \emph{most} inclined to be satisfied with their neighborhoods; bring
  out that in most of these neighborhoods, whites are still the majority
  -- so if they \emph{are} selected, there is still a large proportion
  of whites satisfied living in multiethnic neighborhoods
\item
  Subset by parental status (link to Ann Owens' ASR paper)
\item
  Point out that this study is unique to some degree to DC, which is a
  type of multiethnic metropolitan area that is often overlooked (it's
  not a black/white city, which are now the anomolies, places like DC
  are the future)

\subsubsection{Potential Journals}\label{potential-journals}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Demography} especially with Mark Hayward as the editor
\item
  Possibly worth trying at a general sociology journal like \emph{Social
  Forces}; subject-matter also fits at \emph{Social Problems} and
  \emph{Social Science Research}
\item
  \emph{Urban Affairs Review}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Future Directions}\label{future-directions}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Do white conservatives look different than white liberals? Maybe find
  a political scientist interested in neighborhoods to collaborate
\item
  Look at paper by Ryan Enos about how the demolition of public housing
  shifted whites' political views:
