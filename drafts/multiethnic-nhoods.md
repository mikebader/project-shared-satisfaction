shorttitle: Shared Satisfaction in Multiracial Neighborhoods
abstract: |
    Multiracial neighborhood integration has become common many US metropolitan areas. Traditional theories of racial change predict low levels of satisfaction in these neighborhoods while an emerging literature argues that multiracial neighborhoods do not fit these traditional theories. This article takes up the question: are residents satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods? The article uses data representing all residents of multiracial neighborhoods in the Washington, DC area to study neighborhood satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods. The analysis finds evidence of *shared satisfaction* among residents regardless of race: large and *equal* shares of each racial group were satisfied. Whites were less satisfied than whites elsewhere in the metropolitan region and were less likely to perceive neighborhood improvement than their neighbors. But the lack of racial antipathy suggests that multiracial neighborhoods offer places to promote racial equity.

Multiracial neighborhoods---those neighborhoods shared among Asian, Black, Latino, and white neighbors---have become common in many metropolitan areas. Made possible by immigration reform and fair housing legislation that passed in the 1960s, the number of multiracial neighborhoods has grown since the 1980s [@logan_global_2010; @bader_fragmented_2016; @holloway_racially_2012]. In addition to traditional ports of entry like New York City and Los Angeles, multiracial neighborhoods have become more common in "new immigrant" destinations and metropolitan areas with large shares of immigrants [@singer_twenty-first_2008; @zhang_global_2016]. 

Nearly all theories of urban change would not have predicted the emergence of multiracial neighborhoods, let alone their increasing prevalence. Theories of urban change tend to build on the human ecological model of inter-group competition for resources [@burgess_growth_1984; @park_human_1936; @mckenzie_ecological_1984]. Racial identity is thought to represent such a chasm between groups that racial integration undermines neighborhood cohesion and leads residents to become dissatisfied [@putnam_e_2007; @duncan_negro_1957]. The few integrated neighborhoods that existed were held up as notable exceptions to the general rule of dissatisfaction and change [@taub_paths_1984]. 

The recent growth and stability of multiracial neighborhoods contradict traditional theories of racial change. Recent qualitative research demonstrates that residents different races are satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods [e.g., @lumley-sapanski_planning_2017; @spitz_segregated_2015]. Through ethnographic methods, these researchers find that racial diversity becomes a collective identity that residents work to protect. The contradiction between these more recent studies and the traditional theories of neighborhood change calls into question the general rule that integration begets neighborhood dissatisfaction. Yet, due to their methods, it is difficult to determine whether these neighborhoods represent exceptions to the general rule of dissatisfaction or are instead part of a larger trend of shared interracial satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods. 

This article overcomes these problems by using data from a sample that represents residents living in all multiracial neighborhoods across an entire metropolitan region. The data favor the conclusion that multiracial neighborhoods engender a shared satisfaction among residents of all races. A large majority of residents are satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods, and the level of satisfaction does not vary by race of residents. White residents of multiracial neighborhoods report lower satisfaction than white counterparts elsewhere in the region. Yet the similar levels of satisfaction that whites feel compared to their neighbors of color and that few whites perceive an association between integration and neighborhood decline point to deficiencies of traditional urban theories to explain *multiracial* integration. Based on these representative data, I conclude that qualitative research on the topic has not simply found anomalous cases of shared satisfaction. Instead, multiracial neighborhoods engender interracial neighborhood satisfaction and could be a structure that levels opportunities in US metropolitan areas. 

# Racial Integration as a Disintegrating Social Force

The most dominant theories of neighborhood change predict lower satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods than in other types of neighborhoods. These theories rest on the foundational notion that racial group identity organizes society to such a strong degree that racial differences undermine social cohesion among neighbors [@park_city:_1984; @bursik_community_1982; @blumer_race_1958]. The origins of these theories go back to the Chicago School, who developed the theory of invasion-succession to explain why neighborhoods change [@park_city:_1984]. Neighborhoods evolved to conform to the needs of one ethnic group. Competition over the use of space and other resources occurs after the entry, or "invasion," by another group and the exit, or "succession" of the incumbent group [@mckenzie_ecological_1984; @park_human_1936; @duncan_negro_1957].[^black-belt]

[^black-belt]: It bears mentioning that the original Chicago School sociologists did not have such a developed theory for *racial* differences. Burgess' -@burgess_growth_1984 reinforced the distinction between racial and ethnic change through the construction of the "Black Belt" that graphically and symbolically highlighted it as an exception to the general theory of the concentric ring model.  

## Social Disorganization

Social disorganization theories built on this foundation argue that racial integration destabilizes neighborhoods. Interested in explaining crime and deviance, social disorganization theorists developed the hypothesis that structural conditions undermining social cohesion present opportunities for deviance [@sampson_community_1989; @perkins_participation_1990]. Race, being such a strong social force in American society, undermined cohesion between racial groups, leading to increased deviance and lower satisfaction [@hipp_specifying_2009; @putnam_e_2007]. 

Researchers have consistently found evidence that diversity leads to lower levels of neighborhood satisfaction. Research on patterns of change from the 1950s to the 1980s showed that that the entry of Black residents into white neighborhoods led whites to flee and the neighborhood to turnover rapidly [@duncan_negro_1957; @taeuber_negroes_1965; @bader_fragmented_2016]. The erosion of social cohesion exacerbated interracial differences and contributed to white flight [@taub_paths_1984]. Recent evidence also supports the hypothesis that racial diversity undermines social cohesion, lowers neighborhood satisfaction, and increases violence [@hipp_specifying_2009; @legewie_contested_2016; @green_defended_1998]. 

Robert Putnam -@putnam_e_2007 presented a new context for the theory that racial and ethnic differences undermine social capital. He argued that cultural differences between groups reduce interpersonal bonds among neighbors. As a result, local residents constrict their interactions with one another that reduces social capital. His "constrict hypothesis" supposed that the United States was following a trend found throughout Western countries and that constriction of interaction occurs across racial and ethnic groups. 

## Uniqueness of White Aversions to Integration

Some evidence contradicts the prediction that racial integration decreases cohesion across racial and ethnic groups. In a review of the literature van der Meer and Tolsma -@van_der_meer_ethnic_2014 found that the association only existed in the US, and even then the sentiment was limited to whites. Notably, Abascal and Baldassarri -@abascal_love_2015 argued that the apparent lack of trust in multiracial neighborhoods represents a statistical artifact caused by underlying differences in baseline trust. When examining race-by-composition interactions, they concluded that "it is not ethnoracial diversity per se that makes whites apparently 'hunker down' but rather the presence of nonwhites, particularly blacks and Hispanics" [@abascal_love_2015, p. 755]. White antipathy rather than racial integration served as the mechanism that undermined trust.

Evidence that whites react differently to racial integration than other racial groups receives support from two other literatures. The first literature comes from the defended neighborhood hypothesis [@suttles_social_1972]. The hypothesis derives from the idea that community members band together to defend their neighborhoods against outside threats. In the context of race relations throughout most of American history, the defense included guarding against non-white residents moving into neighborhoods [@sugrue_origins_1996; @lukas_common_1985]. Racialized perceptions of places led whites to perceive neighborhoods with fewer whites as less desirable and less safe than those with more whites [@swaroop_determinants_2011; @quillian_black_2001; @sampson_seeing_2004]. If the defenses failed, the most well-to-do whites left. The "limited liability" view of neighborhoods [@janowitz_community_1967] means that the most disgruntled whites remained, frustrated by both their dissatisfaction with integration and indignation that wealthier whites were able to leave [@sugrue_origins_1996]. The lower regard that other whites hold of their neighborhoods and the resulting lower home values may further frustrate incumbent white residents [@harris_property_1999; @howell_increasing_2020].

Evidence for the uniqueness of white dissatisfaction also comes from research on racial residential preferences. This body of work shows a correlation between the white share of residents in neighborhoods and the percentage of whites who express a preference for those neighborhoods [@charles_dynamics_2003; @krysan_cycle_2017]. The strong influence of racial composition has been consistent using a variety of methods including experimental designs, stated preferences for specific neighborhoods, and drawing ideal neighborhood compositions [@lewis_who_2011; @krysan_does_2009; @charles_neighborhood_2000]. That whites also reveal these same preferences when moving further confirms the influence of whiter racial compositions on white preferences and satisfaction [@crowder_racial_2000; @crowder_neighborhood_2012; @quillian_why_2002]. People of color, in contrast, prefer neighborhoods with a wider diversity of residents [@charles_neighborhood_2000; @krysan_cycle_2017; @bader_community_2015]. While they show some preference for own-race neighbors, the preferences are small compared to those expressed by whites [@charles_neighborhood_2000]. And, among some subgroups, people of color show a greater preference and more satisfaction as the share of white neighbors increases [@greif_intersection_2015; @bader_community_2015]. 

# Shared Satisfaction with Multiracial Integration

A small but growing body of research finds that multiracial neighborhoods develop cohesion around the notion of diversity. The studies examine multiracial neighborhoods as a distinct type of racial integration distinct from the dual-group model of the invasion\slash succession model. Lumley-Sapanksi and Fowler -@lumley-sapanski_planning_2017 showed residents of all races were satisfied living in a "hyperdiverse" neighborhood in Seattle. Groups compromised with one another, getting some, but not all, of what they desired in order to maintain neighborhood diversity. Similarly, Spitz -@spitz_segregated_2015 finds that neighborhood residents value diversity in a multiracial neighborhood in Milwaukee. In both cases, residents were willing to trade off their optimal neighborhood conditions to sustain racial diversity. This was true even if residents lacked strong interpersonal bonds that bridged racial groups. These more recent studies echo Maly's -@maly_beyond_2005 argument that collective identities develop around racial diversity in integrated neighborhoods that help different groups feel satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods [see also, @nyden_neighborhood_1998]. Collectively these studies present a compelling argument for what I'll call "shared satisfaction" among residents of multiracial neighborhoods.

Demographic analyses reveal a persistence of multiracial integration over several decades that support the shared satisfaction perspective. Logan and Zhang [-@logan_global_2010; -@logan_global_2011] identified neighborhoods based on a presence of Asian, Black, Latino, and white residents commensurate with their metropolitan composition. They termed those neighborhoods where all four groups were present "global neighborhoods" based on the common roots with the rise of "global cities" based on finance and international flows of trade [@sassen_global_1991]. They estimated that 38 percent of neighborhoods in 2010 were global neighborhoods [@logan_global_2011]. Bader and Warkentien -@bader_fragmented_2016 used a model-based approach of classifying neighborhoods. They found that "quadrivial neighborhoods," those with stable or slow change in the percentage of Asian, Black, Latino, and white residents over four decades, made up between eight and twenty percent of neighborhoods in the metropolitan areas of the four largest US cities. 

Recent studies of racial preferences show a growing appreciation for diverse neighborhoods among whites. In interviews of white parents in two different cities, Darrah-Okike and colleagues -@darrah-okike_because_2020 found that parents valued diversity of their neighborhoods when searching for housing. Similarly, using survey data, Krysan and colleagues -@krysan_diversity_2017 showed that multiracial neighborhoods were the most desired type of neighborhood across racial groups. The white participants in the study were, however, averse to living in neighborhoods integrated only with black or Latino residents [@bader_community_2015].

# Are People Satisfied Living in Multiracial Neighborhoods?

Multiracial neighborhoods warrant more research because of their novelty (having emerged since the 1980s), their growing number, and because of their questionable fit with traditional urban theories of neighborhood change. The newness of multiracial integration raises an empirical question of whether residents are satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods that emerged since the 1980s. Much of the data supporting the disorganizing influence of integration come from periods when multiracial neighborhoods only just started emerging. For example, Hipp's -@hipp_specifying_2009 study, the most comprehensive study of neighborhood satisfaction in the US, used data as far back as 1987 to draw the conclusion that integration leads to dissatisfaction. The number of multiracial neighborhoods would have been exceedingly small and the neighborhoods were most likely unique.

The ethnographic studies cited above, which have been conducted relatively recently, show that residents of all races are satisfied. Whether those studies undermine general theories of racial change, however, depends on whether the studies represent anomalous cases or a consistent pattern among residents living in a variety of multiracial neighborhoods. These ethnographic studies come from specific neighborhoods that explicitly developed with diversity as part of their identity. Researchers entered the field after neighborhoods integrated. As a result, researchers might have missed residents who left because they were dissatisfied (or worried that they might become dissatisfied) and might also be observing people uniquely drawn to move into racial diverse neighborhoods. The whites that the researchers observe might be especially atypical since research finds that whites typically restrict searches to whiter neighborhoods at each stage of their housing searches [@havekes_realizing_2016]. 

## Dimensions of Satisfaction 

This article addresses these empirical and theoretical limitations by studying a representative sample of residents living in a major metropolitan region. Guided by contrasting visions of multiracial integration given by the traditional urban theories of change and the shared satisfaction perspective, I studied three dimensions of satisfaction. The two visions offer contrasting hypotheses in each that I describe more briefly below and summarize in Table \ref{tab:theory}. *Internal satisfaction*, the first dimension, is the clearest: are equal shares of residents of each race satisfied living in their multiracial neighborhoods? The shared satisfaction perspective clearly predicts the answer is "yes," while traditional urban theories predict the answer is "no." 

\abouthere{Table}{tab:theory}

While internal satisfaction represents the principal direction from which satisfaction should be viewed, theoretical differences exist along two other dimensions. *Comparative satisfaction* asks whether residents in multiracial neighborhoods are similarly satisfied as same-race counterparts elsewhere in their region. Equal shares of groups could be satisfied in multiracial neighborhoods, but the rate could be equally low compared to other neighborhoods in the metropolitan area. On this dimensions, traditional theories diverge. One view, represented by Putnam's -@putnam_e_2007 constrict theory posits residents of multiracial neighborhoods find less satisfaction in their neighborhoods than same-race counterparts elsewhere. The other view, represented by Abascal and Baldassarri -@abascal_love_2015, predicts that only whites will be less satisfied. The strongest version of the qualitative evidence advancing the shared satisfaction perspective predicts equal satisfaction between residents of multiracial neighborhoods and same-race counterparts elsewhere in the region [e.g., @maly_beyond_2005]. The lack of comparative data, however, leaves substantial uncertainty around this prediction. 

Finally, I investigated *internal perspectives of neighborhood change* within neighborhoods. Traditional urban theories predict that the whites remaining in integrated neighborhoods negatively perceive neighborhood changes associated with integration. White's perceptions could come from the racial animosity they feel toward non-white neighbors or come from the fear that outsiders would develop a dimmer view of their neighborhoods. The shared satisfaction perspective, in contrast, predicts that residents find ways of being happy and letting each other find that satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods. As a result, racial identity would not predict strong differences in the perceptions of change. Yet, qualitative researchers generally enter the field *after* neighborhoods integrate, and might miss those residents who might have been satisfied but worried about the direction of neighborhood change. Analyzing data across all multiracial neighborhoods captures neighborhoods that have remained integrated over time as well as those that recently experienced multiracial integration. 

## Representative Data to Study Residents of Multiracial Neighborhoods
Collectively these dimensions provide a basis to assess whether residents of all races are satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods. To investigate these three dimensions, I use what is to my knowledge the first survey that represents residents living in multiracial neighborhoods across a metropolitan region. From these data and a companion survey representing the larger metropolitan region, I investigate the empirical and theoretical questions raised above. With these two sources of data, I can make inferences that generalize to residents of multiracial neighborhoods that have been impossible to date. 

The research raises practical as well as theoretical concerns. Long-term multiracial integration offers a concrete opportunity on which to build a pluralist orientation in American life. If residents find satisfaction living in multiracial neighborhoods, then those neighborhoods help dismantle segregation, the "linchpin" of racial inequality [@pettigrew_racial_1979]. Yet the opportunity will unlikely be realized if residents are dissatisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods. Worse, dissatisfaction could breed resentment and set back the effort of dismantling segregation. I discuss both the theoretical and practical concerns after presenting the results of the analysis, in which I find evidence that, on balance, supports the shared satisfaction perspective. 


# Data & Methods

I tested these hypotheses using what I believe to be the first representative sample of residents living in multiracial neighborhoods in a large metropolitan area. After describing the samples upon which the analysis is based, I present the results that show evidence from analytical models measuring levels of neighborhood satisfaction. 

## Study Region
Data to test the hypotheses come from two samples of Washington, DC-area residents in 2016 and 2018. Washington, DC has historically been a black\slash white segregated metropolitan area. Asians and Latinos each made up only 3 percent of the DC-area population in 1980. Almost all Blacks lived in the eastern part of the city and nearly all whites in the western part. This east-west pattern spilled out to the Maryland suburbs with the eastern suburbs of Prince George's County containing large shares of black residents compared to its western neighbor, Montgomery County, that has a whiter population. A few Blacks lived across the Potomac River in Northern Virginia, though they were highly clustered in a small number of neighborhoods. 

The region's economy grew and became less based on the federal government in the 1980s and 1990s. The expansion of finance, insurance, and real estate services sector mirrored the sector's prominence in redeveloping metropolitan areas in the U.S. and abroad. Real estate developers capitalized on the expanding population by developing large swaths of land in middle-ring suburbs encircling the District. Having been built after the Fair Housing Act passed, the housing developed was not subject to the history of redlining and restrictive covenants. 

During the same period, the region emerged as an immigrant destination: by 2015 a quarter of residents were born outside of the United States, with the largest shares of foreign-born residents having come from El Salvador, India, and Korea. Latinos and Asians now comprise 16 and 11 percent of DC-area residents, respectively, while Blacks make up 29 percent and whites 41 percent of the population. As the nation's capital and a major center for international relations, the region's foreign-born residents are more socioeconomically diverse than average. Among foreign-born residents ages 25 and older in the DC area, 21 percent have a bachelor's degree and 22 percent have a graduate degree, compared to 17 percent and 12 percent nationally. 

Residents of all races were attracted to new suburban homes since 1980, especially in Montgomery and Fairfax Counties that boasted nationally renowned school systems. Additionally, Montgomery County has, since 1974, mandated that all housing developments larger than 20 units include a set percentage of units that qualify as affordable housing [@urban_institute_expanding_2012].[^fairfax] As Figure \ref{fig:map} shows, multiracial neighborhoods were especially likely to emerge along the hub-and-spoke system of the region's commuter rail lines in these counties [see also, @holloway_racially_2012].

\abouthere{Figure}{fig:map}

[^fairfax]: Fairfax County passed an inclusionary zoning ordinance in 1971, but it was struck down by the Virginia Supreme Court. Fairfax County implemented a different mandatory inclusionary zoning policy in 1990 [@silverstein_welcome_2017].

## Survey Samples

Both surveys represented residents in the Washington, DC area, which comprised Washington, DC and the surrounding jurisdictions of Montgomery and Prince George's Counties in Maryland, Arlington and Fairfax (including the cities of Falls Church and Fairfax) Counties Virginia, and the independent city of Alexandria, Virginia, an area that comprises 4,096,851 residents. The 2016 DC Area Survey represents residents of two types of neighborhoods: multiracial and disproportionately Latino. Analyses for this study only include responses from residents sampled in the multiracial neighborhoods. 

Multiracial neighborhoods included in the 2016 DCAS sampling frame met two criteria. First, neighborhoods comprised at least 10 percent Asian, Black, Latino, and white residents. This cutoff was used to ensure that each of the four racial groups represented a distinguishable subset of a neighborhood's residents. Second, none of those four groups could represent a majority of residents. This criterion was included to eliminate neighborhoods where a single group formed the dominant identity of the neighborhood.[^latino-enclaves] These criteria resulted in a sample frame of 114 neighborhoods that represented just under 585,000 people.[^one-criterion] The majority of neighborhoods were in Montgomery County, Maryland, followed by Fairfax County, Virginia, then Prince George's County, Maryland. The neighborhoods included in the sampling frame are shown in Figure \ref{fig:map}. An address-based sample of households was drawn from these eligible neighborhoods. The sample design included over-samples of households with Asian and Hispanic surnames and households located in from disproportionately Black tracts among those that still satisfied the criteria to be included as multiracial neighborhoods. Statistics describing the multiracial neighborhood sample of the 2016 DCAS data are reported in Table \ref{tab:descriptives16}.

[^latino-enclaves]: Disproportionately Latino neighborhoods were those in which Latino residents made up at least a quarter of the residents and were not already classified as a multiracial neighborhood.

[^one-criterion]: Eighteen neighborhoods met the first inclusion criterion but not the second. Of those eighteen, fifteen were neighborhoods that had a white majority; six were located in Fairfax County, Virginia (including one in Fairfax city), five in Montgomery County, Maryland, and two each in DC and Arlington County, Virginia. Two neighborhoods had a Black majority, one each in Montgomery County and Prince George's County, and only one neighborhood, in Montgomery County, had a Latino majority. 

\abouthere{Table}{tab:descriptives16}

Table \ref{tab:nhddescriptives} contains a comparison of multiracial neighborhoods to all neighborhoods in the DC area. Whites make up about a third of multiracial neighborhoods, on average, while Latinos make up about a quarter. Blacks and Asians make up 22 and 18 percent of residents, respectively. Immigration represented the largest deviation of multiracial neighborhoods from DC-area neighborhoods overall. Immigrants make up two of every five residents in multiracial neighborhoods, compared to just under one of every four residents in neighborhoods overall. Residents of multiracial neighborhoods had slightly lower educational attainment than neighborhoods overall. One in four residents of multiracial neighborhoods, however, had a bachelor's degree and one in five had a post-graduate degree. Married households and those with children comprised a larger share of households in multiracial neighborhoods compared to DC-area neighborhoods overall.

\abouthere{Table}{tab:nhddescriptives}

The 2018 DC Area Survey drew a sample representative of the *entire* DC area. The sample was stratified by jurisdiction to guarantee representation of all jurisdictions in the data.[^combined] The 2018 DCAS included over-samples of tracts with disproportionately large Black and Latino populations. Statistics describing the 2018 DCAS data are reported in Table \ref{tab:descriptives18}.

\abouthere{Table}{tab:descriptives18}


[^combined]: Arlington County and the City of Alexandria were combined into a single stratum. 

## Dependent Variable

The analyses used a dichotomous measure of neighborhood satisfaction. Both surveys asked respondents, "How satisfied are you with your neighborhood as a place to live?," a question that has been used in previous research [see, e.g., @woldoff_effects_2002; @greif_intersection_2015]. Respondents who indicated that they were "extremely" or "very" satisfied living in their neighborhood were coded as being satisfied. Those who indicated that they were "somewhat" or "not at all" satisfied were coded as being unsatisfied.

## Independent Variable
A measure created from respondents' self-identified race and ethnicity was the independent variable in all analyses. I classified racial groups into four mutually exclusive categories based on the respondents' answers to questions about race (respondents were allowed to choose multiple racial groups) and Hispanic ethnicity. I classified those respondents who indicated Hispanic ethnicity as *Latino*, regardless of their race. Among the remaining non-Latino respondents, I classified as *white* those who selected white as their only race; as *Black* those identified as Black, either alone or in combination with any other race; and as *Asian* those who identified as Asian or Pacific Islander, either alone or in combination with any race other than Black. Respondents missing on either the race question or the ethnicity question and respondents who did not satisfy the criteria above were not included in the analysis. This left a final analytic dataset of 641 respondents in 2016 and 989 respondents in 2018.

## Control Variables
I included variables to control for other demographic characteristics of residents. I calculated *age* based on respondents' birth year and *gender* based on respondents' gender identity, for which they were given the choices "male," "female," and "other." Female was set as the reference. Only two respondents chose "other" and were coded as missing on this question. I included an indicator for *being partnered* based on those respondents who indicated that they were "now married or in a marriage-style arrangement," with those not currently partnered as the reference.

I included whether the respondent had *children in the household* because the presence of children could affect the outlook residents have of their neighborhoods. The question did not limit the response to respondents' own children. I also included an indicator to measure whether respondents were *foreign born* since immigrant status would likely correlate with residential perceptions and race simultaneously.

I represented socioeconomic status with a measure of *educational attainment*. I created a measure with five categories based on the highest level of education respondents reported: less than high school, high school (including GED), some college (including associates degrees), bachelors degree, and graduate degree. I chose to use educational attainment to measure socioeconomic status because it is a more stable measure than income, and space did not permit the DCAS to ascertain income longitudinally. Income also had more missing data in both 2016 (N=59) and 2018 (N=79) compared to educational attainment (N=15 in 2016 and N=25 in 2018). Among those respondents who answered both questions, however, education and income were highly correlated.

I also included measures of neighborhood experience that account for neighborhood lifecourse characteristics. First, I included the *years respondents lived in their neighborhoods* since the lifecourse model presumes that people will become accustomed to the norms and will become more satisfied as they live in the neighborhood over a longer period. Second, I included a measure of *neighborhood size*. This measure was self-reported by respondents and including it in models accounts for how subjective perceptions of neighborhood boundaries affect satisfaction and perceived change. Table \ref{tab:nhddescriptives} contains descriptive statistics of variables for the complete samples of the 2016 DCAS and the 2018 DCAS, as well as each survey by racial group.

## Analytical Approach

I used logistic regression analysis to test the hypotheses above. The general model is expressed in the equation:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{\eta} = \alpha + \mathbf{\beta^T X} + \mathbf{\gamma^T Z} + \mathbf{\delta_j}
\label{eqn:model}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\mathbf{\eta}$ is the vector of outcomes for respondents transformed using a logistic link function. In the model, $\alpha$ measures the intercept, and $\mathbf{\beta}$ is a vector of point estimates for racial groups (with whites omitted). Non-Latino whites were the reference group since the hypotheses ask whether whites differ from other groups. The vector $\mathbf{\gamma}$ contains point estimates of demographic and neighborhood experience controls, $\mathbf{Z}$. 

Analyses based exclusively on the 2016 data of residents living in multiracial neighborhoods also included a fixed effect, $\mathbf{\delta_j}$, for the neighborhood of residence. Neighborhoods were defined as residents' census tracts. The median neighborhood included five respondents and a maximum of twenty residents lived in the same neighborhood. Nine neighborhoods had only a single respondent. The nine respondents from these neighborhoods were dropped from the analysis. Including neighborhood fixed effects makes the estimates, $\mathbf{\beta}$, reflect the differences between white outcomes and those of Asians, Blacks, and Latinos *living in the same neighborhood*. 

All analyses were conducted in R (version 3.6.3), and they all accounted for missing data and the complex survey design. I used the `Amelia` package [@honaker_amelia_2011] to impute missing values in five datasets. I conducted all analyses using these five datasets weighting outcomes to account for the complex sample design using the `survey` library [@lumley_analysis_2004]. I combined all results using Rubin's [-@rubin_multiple_2004] rules. A replication package that includes all data and code used for the models is available at \[redacted\].

# Results

## Internal Satisfaction

The first analysis examined satisfaction among residents living in multiracial neighborhoods in the DC Area. Consistent with the the shared satisfaction perspective, I found that little variation exists *within* multiracial neighborhoods. Table \ref{tab:descwn} reports the percentage of residents who expressed satisfaction living in multiracial neighborhoods by racial group as well as differences among groups. The first column shows that a large majority of all residents, 71.3 percent, were satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods. It further shows few differences by race. Latino residents had the largest deviation from the overall mean, but that deviation was only 3.7 percentage points. Furthermore, the largest difference between any two groups, Blacks and Latinos, was only 6.2 percentage points.  

\abouthere{Table}{tab:descwn}

Regression analyses further confirmed the lack of interracial variation in neighborhood satisfaction. Table \ref{tab:within} reports the results estimating three models. All three models included a fixed effect for the neighborhood (tract) of residence that allows the estimates to be interpreted as racial differences among residents living in the same neighborhood. 

\abouthere{Table}{tab:within}

The first model included only race and the neighborhood fixed effects. The parameter estimates confirm minimal differences by race. The marginal effects and 95 percent confidence intervals of this model, expressed as percentages of each group predicted to report being satisfied, are shown in Figure \ref{fig:within}. The average marginal effect measuring the difference in the probability of being satisfied compared to white residents of multiracial neighborhoods was -0.8 percent for Asian residents, 5.3 percent for Black residents, and 3.1 percent for Latino residents. 

\abouthere{Figure}{fig:within}

Adjusting for other characteristics contributed only very small increases to the interracial variation. The estimated average marginal effects measuring the difference in probability of being satisfied compared to whites in the full model (also plotted in Figure \ref{fig:within}) increased to 0.6 percent among Asian residents, 6.0 percent among Black residents, and 6.7 percent among Latino residents. These adjusted coefficients confirm that race does little to predict variation in neighborhood satisfaction.

The final row of Table \ref{tab:within} shows further evidence against interracial differences in neighborhood satisfaction among residents of multiracial neighborhoods. The row reports the Akaike information criterion (AIC), a measure that balances a model’s parsimony with its goodness of fit to the data [@akaike_new_1974]. Lower values indicate better fit, and the results show that the data fit a model without race (reported in the third column) better than a model including race (reported in the second column). Wald-F statistics across all imputed datasets confirm that the data fit the model that excluded race better than the model that included race.

These findings provide evidence that residents of all races are equally satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods. White residents, among whom the racial stratification theories would predict to be dissatisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods, were just as satisfied as their neighbors of color. What is more, a large majority of all four racial groups, ranging from 68.3 to 75.1 percent, reported being satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods. The widespread level of satisfaction among all four racial groups supports the shared satisfaction model of multiracial integration. 

## Comparative Satisfaction

I compared the difference between satisfaction with multiracial neighborhoods to neighborhood satisfaction among residents in general. In particular, I focused on comparisons between same-race residents. The traditional theories of neighborhood change (i.e., social disorganization and defended neighborhoods) predict lower satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods. Recall, however, that two separate hypotheses predict different patterns: Putnam's -@putnam_e_2007 "constrict theory" predicts lower satisfaction among all racial groups while Abascal and Baldassarri -@abascal_love_2015 predict lower satisfaction only among whites. In contrast to both, the strongest form of the shared satisfaction perspective predicts that residents of multiracial neighborhoods will be as satisfied as residents elsewhere in the region. To examine these hypotheses, I compared models estimated using the multiracial sample from the 2016 DCAS to models estimated using the DC area-wide sample from the 2018 DCAS. I used the model in Equation \ref{eqn:model} without neighborhood fixed-effects. 

Table \ref{tab:descbn} shows neighborhood satisfaction among residents of the DC area. Among residents of the entire DC area, 78.3 percent were satisfied in their neighborhoods. Consistent with the social disorganization hypothesis, this was 7.6 percentage points higher than satisfaction felt among residents of multiracial neighborhoods ($p{<}0.05$ from a two-sample t-test). But Table \ref{tab:descbn} also shows that the lower satisfaction levels could be largely attributed to white residents. White residents of multiracial neighborhoods were 16.2 percent less likely to be satisfied with their neighborhoods than white residents in the DC area ($p{<}0.001$). Asian residents of multiracial neighborhoods were also less likely to be satisfied than DC-area Asian residents, but the difference was insufficiently large to be confident that it did not arise from sampling error ($p{=}0.200$). Black multiracial neighborhood residents were 2.1 percentage points less likely to be satisfied than Black DC-area residents generally, while Latinos were about equally likely to be satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods as elsewhere in the DC area. 

\abouthere{Table}{tab:descbn}

The pattern of lower satisfaction exclusively among whites held after controlling for other demographic and neighborhood characteristics. Figure \ref{fig:between} shows the predicted value of neighborhood satisfaction for different racial groups from separate models estimated for the multiracial neighborhood and the complete DC-area sample. I calculated the predicted value at the mean value of each control variable at the mean value of each variable in the metropolitan-wide (i.e., DCAS 2018) sample.[^MEM] The plot shows a clear difference in satisfaction between white people living in multiracial neighborhoods and white residents in the DC area, while it also shows small differences for other groups. The share of Asian residents of multiracial neighborhoods satisfied in multiracial neighborhoods was only 3.5 percentage points lower than the share of satisfied DC-area Asian residents. Almost no difference existed between Black residents of multiracial neighborhoods and Black residents overall. Latino residents of multiracial neighborhoods were *more likely* to be satisfied than Latinos overall after controlling for individual characteristics. 

\abouthere{Figure}{fig:between}

[^MEM]: These marginal effects at the mean (MEM) differ from the average marginal effect (AME) plotted in Figure \ref{fig:within}. The MEM allows the comparisons to be made at comparable values *across* the two datasets with substantially different marginal distributions (the AME plots the marginal effect averaged over respondents *within* a dataset).

These results cast doubt on the universality of the Putnam's -@putnam_e_2007 constrict theory. Black and Latino residents of multiracial neighborhoods were equally or more satisfied than their counterparts elsewhere in the metropolitan area. Even among Asians, the difference between multiracial neighborhood residents and metropolitan residents generally was small after controlling for individual characteristics. Only among whites did living in a multiracial neighborhood predict lower levels of satisfaction. The result affirms Abascal and Baldassarri's -@abascal_love_2015 white exceptionalism findings. In addition to providing against the "constrict theory," the results also cast doubt on the strongest view of the shared satisfaction perspective that whites find as much satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods as other neighborhoods. 



## Internal Perceptions of Neighborhood Change

Lower satisfaction among whites creates a particularly disconcerting situation if those white residents living in multiracial neighborhoods were concerned about changes in their neighborhoods. The final analysis, of internal perceptions of change, addresses this concern. Traditional urban theories predict that a large share, if not a majority, of white residents will perceive their neighborhood as declining after it integrates. The shared satisfaction perspective, predicts the opposite. 

The 2016 DCAS asked for responses to the prompt, "Looking back over the past five years or so, would you say that your neighborhood has...," and allowed respondents to choose from five responses: become a much better (worse) place to live, become a somewhat better (worse) place to live, or stayed about the same. I recoded responses into three categories representing whether respondents reported their neighborhoods getting better, worse, or staying the same. Because this was one of the first questions asked on the survey, and because it came before any questions about the respondent's own race or racial attitudes, respondents were not primed to think about neighborhood changes in the context of racial change. 

Overall, 34.5 percent of all residents living in multiracial neighborhoods thought that their neighborhoods improved over the previous five years. In contrast, only 11.5 percent of residents thought that their neighborhoods got worse. Just over half, 54.0 percent thought that the neighborhood stayed the same. Figure \ref{fig:change} plots, by race, the percentage of residents living in multiracial neighborhoods that think that their neighborhoods have gotten better, gotten worse, or stayed the same. Black and Latino residents were as likely as white residents to report that multiracial neighborhoods have gotten worse, contrary to the theoretical expectation that whites would perceive neighborhood declines. In all three cases, the percentage of respondents who perceived declining neighborhood conditions was small. 

\abouthere{Figure}{fig:change}

White residents were, however, less likely to think that their neighborhoods improved: only 26.9 percent reported that their neighborhoods improved while 60.4 percent believed that the neighborhood stayed the same. In comparison, 37.8 percent of Asian residents, 36.9 percent of Black residents, and 39.5 percent of Latino residents reported that their neighborhoods improved. Controls in a regression model did not account for white residents' lower propensity to perceive neighborhood improvement in multiracial neighborhoods. Table \ref{tab:change} reports estimates of a race-only model and a model with the complement of controls, including neighborhood fixed effects, predicting perceived neighborhood improvement. Racial differences diminished only slightly in the models that included controls, especially the differences between whites and both Blacks and Latinos. The average marginal effects of race on neighborhood improvement from the full model compared to white residents were 13.8 percent for Black residents ($p{=}0.006$), 14.4 percent for Latinos ($p{=}0.010$), and 10.5 percent for Asians ($p{=}0.033$). The data fit the model including race better than the model without race.[^multinomial]

\abouthere{Table}{tab:change}

[^multinomial]: A multinomial model supported the absence of racial variation in negative evaluations of neighborhood change. The results did not show significant effect of racial identity in evaluating the neighborhood as having improved, either. The multinomial models, however, have very large standard errors because the models included neighborhood fixed-effects for 112 neighborhoods in each of two outcomes. The results of the multinomial models are included in the supplement. 

That a smaller share of whites perceive improvement than their neighborhoods of color deserves context in light of theories of urban development. Although a smaller share of whites see neighborhood improvements, a *majority* perceive no change. And, a quarter of white residents do perceive improvement. These results provide a strong counterclaim against traditional urban theories that predict white disgruntlement with integration. While the results do not fully support the shared satisfaction model of integration, where whites view changes as positively as neighbors of color, the balance of the results in this case falls closer to shared satisfaction than white antipathy. 

# Discussion

## Shared Satisfaction Among Residents of Multiracial Neighborhoods
Multiracial neighborhoods have become a feature of many US metropolitan areas, and this study asked whether residents find satisfaction living in them. I examined this topic with, to my knowledge, the first representative sample of residents living in multiracial neighborhoods in a metropolitan area. Among residents from over 100 multiracial neighborhoods across an entire metropolitan region, I found that 71 percent of residents are satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods, and that satisfaction *does not vary* by race. This evidence supports the shared satisfaction perspective of multiracial integration. By doing so, it undermines the premise of using traditional urban theories that predict distrust and social disorganization in multiracial neighborhoods. 

The analysis of comparative satisfaction, however, tempers the strongest interpretation of shared satisfaction. The strongest interpretation posits that satisfaction rates would equal those of other neighborhoods. The  interpretation clearly holds among Blacks and Latinos and likely holds among Asians. The interpretation, however, does not hold among whites. My evidence concurs with past research that only whites experience lower levels of satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods [c.f., @van_der_meer_ethnic_2014; @abascal_love_2015]. Yet evidence of white antipathy predicted by traditional theories also seems unlikely since more than three-fifths of white residents perceive no change in neighborhood quality and 26 percent view changes positively. Cumulatively, these findings support the shared satisfaction perspective while raising questions for more research that I describe more below. 

## Multiracial Neighborhoods as Leveling Structures

Multiracial neighborhoods might offer a structure that levels satisfaction rates across the population. Given the racist development of metropolitan neighborhoods, it might be no surprise that white satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods is lower than that of whites generally. Opportunity hoarding among whites, especially middle-class whites, mean that predominantly white neighborhoods tend to have a surfeit of economic, cultural, and political resources. Whites in the comparison group acquire disproportionate access these resources and, possibly as a result, end up more satisfied. Whites living in multiracial neighborhoods, in contrast, may end up confronting the lack of access people of color experience. 

Preferences for integration might also explain why larger shares of Asians, Blacks, and Latinos perceive neighborhood improvement than whites. Past research shows that all three groups profess stronger preferences for integration than whites [@charles_neighborhood_2000; @bader_community_2015]. Until recently, whites overwhelmingly rejected integration [@charles_wont_2006; @krysan_diversity_2017]. That neighborhood integration precipitated neutral feelings rather than negative feelings in this study reflects a marked contrast to traditional theories of racial integration. 

In summary, multiracial neighborhoods may level access to resources and, as a result, level perceptions of satisfaction. This comparative analysis deserves future research, especially given the implications for redistributive policies.
Although whites may be less satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods than in other neighborhoods, they end up with a similar level of satisfaction felt by other racial groups in the metropolitan. Changes in multiracial neighborhoods improve the neighborhoods in the eyes of people of color while not diminishing neighborhoods in 87 percent of whites. That these changes happen while invoking a positive sentiment about the neighborhoods among most whites indicates that integration does not impose too substantial of a cost on their enjoyment of neighborhoods. 

The belief that whites end up dissatisfied when living in integrated neighborhoods has stymied progress toward policies promoting integration. The results of this study, in combination with the previous literature, should alleviate these concerns since an equal-sized majority of all racial groups find satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods. Policymakers may wish to start by affirmatively marketing multiracial neighborhoods. Knowledge about neighborhoods tends to differ by race [@krysan_racial_2009; @krysan_cycle_2017]. Less familiarity with specific multiracial neighborhoods might prevent movers from searching in multiracial neighborhoods. Affirmative marketing campaigns can use the finding of a shared sense of satisfaction as they feature multiracial neighborhoods. 

At the same time, multiracial neighborhoods do not constitute a panacea. Racial integration requires trading off benefits and costs [@bell_silent_2005]. There are good reasons to support further racial integration, but integration itself does not represent an unalloyed good. People of color, and Blacks in particular, are already aware of the trade-offs and have been negotiating these trade-offs for decades [@lacy_blue-chip_2007; @lewis-mccoy_inequality_2014; @lewis_race_2003]. Integration promotes a sense of the "real world," but also exposes them to the incivilities and daily danger of racism [@lacy_blue-chip_2007]. Policies that promote racial integration should also attend to the inclusion and access of residents living in those spaces. That shared satisfaction exists in multiracial neighborhoods does not, however, preclude the possibility that bi-racial integration leads to declining satisfaction and animosity. Future research should investigate satisfaction in different types of integrated neighborhoods.

## Improving Theories of Urban Change Based on Shared Satisfaction
The evidence in this article shows that, on balance, future research should investigate why multiracial neighborhoods sustain equal rates of satisfaction among residents across racial groups. While racial groups all find satisfaction, they might do so for different reasons. Knowing which amenities appeal to different groups will be important to understand multiracial integration and must play a central role in policies that support multiracial integration. 

Research should also further investigate findings among whites. As I note above, racial antipathy appears unlikely in multiracial neighborhoods. Yet, lower satisfaction than whites in the metropolitan region and the less positive views of change than their neighbors also reveals a lack of enthusiasm. Future research should investigate the lack of enthusiasm. One cause might be ambivalence: whites like that their neighborhood integrates around them while simultaneously not searching out diversity themselves. Whites might tire of negotiating racial differences in their communities. The work required (that whites have often expected of people of color in white neighborhoods) could exhaust or frustrate white residents. The results in this study do not provide an answer, but they do suggest that a perspective that begins by acknowledging interracial shared satisfaction might find greater success than one that presumes social disorganization. 

DC differs from other metropolitan areas in ways that might increase the chance of satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods. The DC area includes jurisdictions that originated inclusive zoning policies that contribute to racial integration. In addition, the DC area ranks at the top or among the top metropolitan areas for educational attainment among Blacks and Latinos, and tends to draw immigrants from across the economic spectrum. All of these factors may help residents of multiracial neighborhoods build bonds across race more easily.[^identification]

[^identification]: While these factors might limit the generalizability of findings from the DC area, they also helped isolate racial effects in the data since race does not correlate as strongly with educational attainment and immigration in the DC area as it does in other metropolitan areas. 

Finally, the DC area suggests that studies of *suburban* integration should also be a priority. The suburbs contain the vast majority of multiracial neighborhoods in the DC area. Although a larger share of multiracial neighborhoods might exist in the DC area compared to other metropolitan areas, several recent studies document the suburban expansion of multiracial neighborhoods. These neighborhoods rarely have a multiracial identity among metropolitan residents, if they have any identity at all, and might provide unique insight into the racial dynamics of contemporary metropolitan areas. 

# Conclusion

This article finds that a large share of residents are satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods and, more importantly, that Asian, Black, Latino, and white residents express satisfaction in equal numbers. This study contributes to a growing literature showing that residents across races share find similar satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods. In contrast to previous studies, it does so using a study representative of residents in multiracial neighborhoods that allows the claim to be more general than past studies allowed. Multiracial neighborhoods, especially those in the suburbs should be studied more frequently to explain the contemporary relationship between race and place. In doing so, studies will likely break with traditional theories of racial change in ways valuable to promoting racial equity.
