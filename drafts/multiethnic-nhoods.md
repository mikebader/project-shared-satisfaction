shorttitle: Shared Satisfaction in Multiracial Neighborhoods
abstract: |
    Multiracial neighborhood integration has become more common in US metropolitan areas over the past three decades. Traditional theories of racial change predict low levels of satisfaction in these neighborhoods while newer studies question that prediction. This article takes up the question: are residents satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods? The article uses data representing all residents of multiracial neighborhoods in the Washington, DC area to study neighborhood satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods. The analysis finds evidence of *shared satisfaction* among residents regardless of race: large and *equal* shares of each racial group were satisfied. White residents were less satisfied than white residents of neighborhoods elsewhere in the metropolitan region, but were unlikely to perceive neighborhood decline. The shared satisfaction among residents of all races and the lack of racial antipathy to change among white residents suggests that multiracial neighborhoods offer sites to promote racial equity.

Multiracial neighborhoods---those neighborhoods shared among Asian, Black, Latino, and white neighbors---have become \revision{more} common in metropolitan areas \revision{since 1980}. Made possible by immigration reform and fair housing legislation that passed in the 1960s, the number of multiracial neighborhoods has grown since the 1980s [@logan_global_2010; @bader_fragmented_2016; @holloway_racially_2012]. In addition to traditional ports of entry like New York City and Los Angeles, multiracial neighborhoods have become more common in "new immigrant" destinations and metropolitan areas with large shares of immigrants [@singer_twenty-first_2008; @zhang_global_2016]. 

Nearly all theories of urban change would not have predicted the emergence of multiracial neighborhoods, let alone their increasing prevalence. Theories of urban change tend to build on the human ecological model of inter-group competition for resources [@burgess_growth_1984; @park_human_1936; @mckenzie_ecological_1984]. Racial identity is thought to represent such a chasm between groups that racial integration undermines neighborhood cohesion and causes residents to become dissatisfied [@putnam_e_2007; @duncan_negro_1957]. The few integrated neighborhoods that existed were held up as notable exceptions to the general rule of dissatisfaction and change [@taub_paths_1984]. 

The recent growth of multiracial neighborhoods contradict traditional theories of racial change. Recent qualitative research demonstrates that residents of different races are satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods [e.g., @lumley-sapanski_planning_2017; @spitz_segregated_2015]. Through ethnographic methods, these researchers find that racial diversity becomes a collective identity that residents work to protect. The contradiction between these more recent studies and the traditional theories of neighborhood change calls into question the general rule that integration begets neighborhood dissatisfaction. Due to their methods, however, it is difficult to determine whether these neighborhoods represent exceptions or are instead part of a larger trend of shared interracial satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods.  

This article overcomes these problems by using data from a sample that represents residents living in all multiracial neighborhoods across an entire metropolitan region. The data favor the conclusion that multiracial neighborhoods engender a shared satisfaction among residents of all races. About 70 percent of residents are satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods, and the level of satisfaction does not vary by the race of residents. White residents of multiracial neighborhoods report lower satisfaction than white counterparts elsewhere in the region. Yet the similar levels of satisfaction that white residents feel compared to their neighbors of color and the small share of white residents who perceive neighborhood declines point to deficiencies of traditional urban theories to explain *multiracial* integration. Based on these representative data, I conclude that qualitative research on the topic has not simply found anomalous cases of shared satisfaction. Instead, multiracial neighborhoods engender interracial neighborhood satisfaction and could be a structure that levels opportunities in US metropolitan areas. 

# Racial Integration as a Disintegrating Social Force

Dominant theories of neighborhood change predict lower satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods than in other types of neighborhoods. These theories rest on the foundational notion that racial group identity organizes society to such a strong degree that racial differences undermine social cohesion among neighbors [@park_city:_1984; @bursik_community_1982; @blumer_race_1958]. The origins of these theories go back to the Chicago School, who developed the theory of invasion-succession to explain why neighborhoods change [@park_city:_1984]. Neighborhoods evolved to conform to the needs of one ethnic group. Competition over the use of space and other resources occurs after the entry, or "invasion," by another group and the exit, or "succession" of the incumbent group [@mckenzie_ecological_1984; @park_human_1936; @duncan_negro_1957].[^black-belt]

[^black-belt]: It bears mentioning that the original Chicago School sociologists did not have such a developed theory for *racial* differences. Burgess -@burgess_growth_1984 reinforced the distinction between racial and ethnic change through the construction of the "Black Belt" that graphically highlighted it as an exception to the general theory of the concentric ring model.  

## Social Disorganization

Social disorganization theories built on this foundation to argue that racial integration destabilizes neighborhoods. Interested in explaining crime and deviance, social disorganization theorists developed the hypothesis that structural conditions undermining social cohesion present opportunities for deviance [@sampson_community_1989; @perkins_participation_1990]. Race, being such a strong social force in American society, undermined cohesion between racial groups, leading to increased deviance and lower satisfaction [@hipp_specifying_2009; @putnam_e_2007]. 

Researchers have consistently found evidence that diversity leads to lower levels of neighborhood satisfaction. Research on patterns of change from the 1950s to the 1980s showed that that the entry of Black residents into white neighborhoods led white residents to flee and the neighborhood to turnover rapidly [@duncan_negro_1957; @taeuber_negroes_1965; @bader_fragmented_2016]. The erosion of social cohesion exacerbated interracial differences and contributed to white flight [@taub_paths_1984]. Recent evidence also supports the hypothesis that racial diversity undermines social cohesion, lowers neighborhood satisfaction, and increases violence [@hipp_specifying_2009; @legewie_contested_2016; @green_defended_1998]. 

Robert Putnam -@putnam_e_2007 offered a new context for the theory that racial and ethnic differences undermine social capital. He argued that cultural differences between groups reduce interpersonal bonds among neighbors. As a result, local residents constrict their interactions with one another that reduces social capital. His "constrict hypothesis" supposed that the United States was following a trend found throughout Western countries and that constriction of interaction occurs across racial and ethnic groups. 

## Uniqueness of White Aversions to Integration

Some evidence contradicts the prediction that racial integration decreases cohesion across racial and ethnic groups. In a review of the literature van der Meer and Tolsma -@van_der_meer_ethnic_2014 found that the association only existed in the US, and even then the sentiment was limited to whites. Notably, Abascal and Baldassarri -@abascal_love_2015 argued that the apparent lack of trust in multiracial neighborhoods represents a statistical artifact caused by underlying differences in baseline trust. When examining race-by-composition interactions, they concluded that "it is not ethnoracial diversity per se that makes whites apparently 'hunker down' but rather the presence of nonwhites, particularly blacks and Hispanics" [@abascal_love_2015, p. 755]. White antipathy rather than racial integration served as the mechanism that undermined trust.

Evidence that white people react differently to racial integration than other racial groups receives support from two other literatures. The first literature comes from the defended neighborhood hypothesis [@suttles_social_1972]. The hypothesis derives from the idea that community members band together to defend their neighborhoods against outside threats. In the context of race relations throughout most of American history, the defense included guarding against non-white residents moving into neighborhoods [@sugrue_origins_1996; @lukas_common_1985]. Racialized perceptions of places led whites to perceive neighborhoods with fewer white residents as less desirable and less safe than those with more white residents [@swaroop_determinants_2011; @quillian_black_2001; @sampson_seeing_2004]. If the defenses failed, the most well-to-do white residents left. The "limited liability" view of neighborhoods [@janowitz_community_1967] means that the most disgruntled white residents remained, frustrated by both their dissatisfaction with integration and indignation that wealthier white residents were able to leave [@sugrue_origins_1996]. The lower regard in which other white residents hold of their neighborhoods, and the resulting lower home values, may further frustrate incumbent white residents [@harris_property_1999; @howell_increasing_2020].

Evidence for the uniqueness of white dissatisfaction also comes from research on racial residential preferences. This body of work shows a correlation between the white share of residents in neighborhoods and the percentage of whites who express a preference for those neighborhoods [@charles_dynamics_2003; @krysan_cycle_2017]. The strong influence of racial composition has been consistent using a variety of methods including experimental designs, stated preferences for specific neighborhoods, and drawing ideal neighborhood compositions [@lewis_who_2011; @krysan_does_2009; @charles_neighborhood_2000]. That whites also reveal these same preferences when moving further confirms the influence of whiter racial compositions on white preferences and satisfaction [@crowder_racial_2000; @crowder_neighborhood_2012; @quillian_why_2002]. People of color, in contrast, prefer neighborhoods with more diverse racial compositions [@charles_neighborhood_2000; @krysan_cycle_2017; @bader_community_2015]. While they show some preference for own-race neighbors, the preferences are small compared to those expressed by whites [@charles_neighborhood_2000]. And, among some subgroups, people of color show a greater preference and more satisfaction as the share of white neighbors increases [@greif_intersection_2015; @bader_community_2015]. 

# Shared Satisfaction with Multiracial Integration

A small but growing body of research finds that multiracial neighborhoods develop cohesion around the notion of diversity. The studies examine multiracial neighborhoods as a distinct type of racial integration distinct from the dual-group model of the invasion\slash succession model. Lumley-Sapanksi and Fowler -@lumley-sapanski_planning_2017 showed residents of all races were satisfied living in a "hyperdiverse" neighborhood in Seattle. Groups compromised with one another, getting some, but not all, of what they desired in order to maintain neighborhood diversity. Similarly, Spitz -@spitz_segregated_2015 finds that neighborhood residents value diversity in a multiracial neighborhood in Milwaukee. In both cases, residents were willing to trade off their optimal neighborhood conditions to sustain racial diversity. \label{rev:matsumoto}\revision{This was true even if residents lacked strong interpersonal bonds that bridged racial groups, and cooperation sometimes occurred by businesses and neighborhood organizations spanning racial divides} [@matsumoto_social_2020]. These recent qualitative studies echo Maly's -@maly_beyond_2005 argument that collective identities develop around racial diversity that help groups feel satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods [see also, @nyden_neighborhood_1998]. Collectively these studies present a compelling argument for what I'll call "shared satisfaction" among residents of multiracial neighborhoods.

\revision{Some demographic evidence also shows that multiracial integration persists, supporting the shared satisfaction perspective.} Logan and Zhang [-@logan_global_2010; -@logan_global_2011] identified neighborhoods based on a presence of Asian, Black, Latino, and white residents commensurate with their metropolitan composition that they termed "global neighborhoods." They estimated that 38 percent of neighborhoods in 2010 were global neighborhoods [@logan_global_2011]. \revision{Ellen and colleagues} [-@ellen_pathways_2012] \revision{found that almost two thirds of multiracially integrated neighborhoods in 2000 remained integrated in 2010.} Another study used a model-based approach and found that between eight and twenty percent of tracts in the metropolitan areas of the four largest metropolitan areas following a trajectory of sustained multiracial integration [@bader_fragmented_2016]. 

Recent studies of racial preferences show a growing appreciation for diverse neighborhoods among whites. In interviews of white parents in two different cities, Darrah-Okike and colleagues -@darrah-okike_because_2020 found that parents valued diversity of their neighborhoods when searching for housing. Similarly, using survey data, Krysan and colleagues -@krysan_diversity_2017 showed that multiracial neighborhoods were the most desired type of neighborhood across racial groups. 

\revision{In contrast to these studies, however, Wright and colleagues} -@wright_instability_2020\revision{ found that almost half of highly diverse neighborhoods in both 1990 and 2000 became less integrated over the subsequent decade. Similarly, Kye and Halpern-Manners }[-@kye_detecting_2019] \revision{found that white residents were generally leaving multiracial neighborhoods, even if a sufficient number remained present to classify the neighborhood as diverse. In addition, even as the white participants in Krysan's study with her colleagues} -@krysan_diversity_2017 \revision{expressed a desire for multiracial neighborhoods, those same participants expressed an aversion to living in neighborhoods integrated only with black or Latino residents }[@bader_community_2015]\revision{. These studies call into question whether a sense of shared satisfaction may generalize to multiracial neighborhoods if one group, namely white residents, are leaving.}\label{rev:shared-satisfaction}

# Are People Satisfied Living in Multiracial Neighborhoods?

Multiracial neighborhoods warrant more research because of their novelty (having overwhelmingly emerged since the 1980s), their growing number, and because of their questionable fit with traditional urban theories of neighborhood change. The newness of multiracial integration raises the empirical question whether residents are satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods that have come about since the 1980s. Much of the data supporting integration as a disorganizing force come from periods when multiracial neighborhoods were only starting to emerge. For example, Hipp's -@hipp_specifying_2009 study, the most comprehensive study of neighborhood satisfaction in the US, used data as far back as 1987 to draw the conclusion that integration leads to dissatisfaction. The number of multiracial neighborhoods would have been exceedingly small and the neighborhoods were most likely unique.

The ethnographic studies cited above, which have been conducted relatively recently, show that residents of all races are satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods. Whether those studies undermine general theories of racial change, however, depends on whether the studies represent anomalous cases or examples of a consistent pattern among residents living in a variety of multiracial neighborhoods. These ethnographic studies come from specific neighborhoods that explicitly developed diversity as part of their collective identity. Researchers entered the field after neighborhoods integrated. As a result, researchers might have missed residents who left because they were dissatisfied (or worried that they might become dissatisfied) and might also be observing people uniquely motivated to move into racially diverse neighborhoods. The white residents that the researchers observe might be atypical since research finds that white movers typically restrict searches to whiter neighborhoods at each stage of their housing searches [@havekes_realizing_2016]. 

## Dimensions of Satisfaction 

This article addresses these empirical and theoretical limitations by studying a representative sample of residents living in a major metropolitan region. Guided by contrasting visions of multiracial integration given by the traditional urban theories of change on the one hand and the shared satisfaction perspective on the other, I studied three dimensions of satisfaction. The two visions offer contrasting hypotheses for each dimension that I describe below and that are summarized in Table \ref{tab:theory}. *Internal satisfaction*, the first and clearest dimension, represents the answer to the question: are equal shares of residents of each race satisfied living in their multiracial neighborhoods? The shared satisfaction perspective clearly predicts the answer is "yes," while traditional urban theories predict the answer is "no." 

\abouthere{Table}{tab:theory}

While internal satisfaction represents the principal direction from which satisfaction should be viewed, theoretical differences exist along two other dimensions. *Comparative satisfaction* asks whether residents in multiracial neighborhoods are similarly satisfied as same-race counterparts elsewhere in their region. Equal shares of groups could be satisfied in multiracial neighborhoods, but the shares could be equally low compared to other neighborhoods in the metropolitan area. On this dimension, traditional theories diverge. One view, represented by Putnam's -@putnam_e_2007 constrict theory posits residents of multiracial neighborhoods find less satisfaction in their neighborhoods than same-race counterparts elsewhere. The other view, represented by Abascal and Baldassarri -@abascal_love_2015, predicts that only whites will be less satisfied. The strongest version of the shared satisfaction perspective predicts equal satisfaction between residents of multiracial neighborhoods and same-race counterparts elsewhere in the region [e.g., @maly_beyond_2005]. The lack of comparative data, however, leaves substantial uncertainty around this prediction. 

Finally, I investigated *internal perspectives of neighborhood change* within neighborhoods. Traditional urban theories predict that the whites remaining in integrated neighborhoods negatively perceive neighborhood changes associated with integration. Whites' perceptions could come from the racial animosity they feel toward non-white neighbors or their perceptions could come from the fear that outsiders would develop a dimmer view of their neighborhoods. The shared satisfaction perspective, in contrast, predicts that residents find ways of being happy and letting each other find satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods. As a result, racial identity would not predict strong differences in the perceptions of change. Qualitative researchers, however, generally enter the field *after* neighborhoods integrate, and might miss those residents who might have been satisfied but worried about the direction of neighborhood change. Comparing sentiments across a representative sample of multiracial neighborhoods would capture neighborhoods that have remained integrated over time as well as those that recently experienced multiracial integration, yet is a near-impossible task using ethnographic methods.

## Representative Data to Study Residents of Multiracial Neighborhoods
Collectively these dimensions provide a basis to assess whether residents of all races are satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods. To investigate these three dimensions, I use what is, to my knowledge, the first survey that represents residents living in multiracial neighborhoods across a metropolitan region. From these data and a companion survey representing the larger metropolitan region, I investigate the empirical and theoretical questions raised above. With these two sources of data, I can make inferences that generalize to residents of multiracial neighborhoods that have been impossible to date. 

The research raises practical as well as theoretical concerns. Long-term multiracial integration offers a concrete opportunity on which to build a pluralist orientation in American life. If residents find satisfaction living in multiracial neighborhoods, then those neighborhoods may help to dismantle segregation, the "linchpin" of racial inequality [@pettigrew_racial_1979]. Yet the opportunity exists only insofar as residents are satisfied. Worse, dissatisfaction could breed resentment and set back the effort of dismantling segregation. I discuss both the theoretical and practical concerns after presenting the results of the analyses that, on balance, support the shared satisfaction perspective. 


# Data & Methods

I tested these hypotheses using what I believe to be the first representative sample of metropolitan residents living in multiracial neighborhoods. After describing the samples upon which the analysis is based, I present the results that show evidence from analytical models measuring levels of neighborhood satisfaction. 

## Study Region
Data to test the hypotheses come from two samples of Washington, DC-area residents, drawn in 2016 and 2018. Washington, DC has historically been a Black\slash white segregated metropolitan area. Asians and Latinos each made up only 3 percent of the DC-area population in 1980. Almost all Black residents lived in the eastern part of the city and nearly all white residents in the western part. This east-west pattern spilled out to the Maryland suburbs with the eastern suburbs in Prince George's County containing large shares of black residents compared to its western neighbor, Montgomery County, that had (and continues to have) a whiter population. A few Black residents lived across the Potomac River in Northern Virginia, though they were highly clustered in a small number of neighborhoods [see also, @pinto-coelho_segregated_2015]. 

The region's economy grew and became less based on the federal government in the 1980s and 1990s. The expansion of finance, insurance, and real estate services sector mirrored the sector's prominence in redeveloping metropolitan areas in the U.S. and abroad. Real estate developers capitalized on the expanding population by developing large swaths of land in middle-ring suburbs encircling the District. Having been built after the Fair Housing Act passed, the housing developed was not subject to the history of redlining and restrictive covenants. 

During the same period, the region emerged as an immigrant destination: by 2015 a quarter of residents were born outside of the United States, with the largest shares of foreign-born residents having come from El Salvador, India, and Korea. Latinos and Asians now comprise 16 and 11 percent of DC-area residents, respectively, while Black residents make up 29 percent and white residents 41 percent of the population. As the nation's capital and a major center for international relations, the region's foreign-born residents are more socioeconomically diverse than average. Among foreign-born residents ages 25 and older in the DC area, 21 percent had a bachelor's degree and 22 percent had a graduate degree, compared to 17 percent and 12 percent nationally. 

Residents of all races were attracted to new suburban homes since 1980, especially in Montgomery and Fairfax Counties that boasted of nationally renowned school systems. Additionally, Montgomery County has, since 1974, mandated that all housing developments larger than 20 units include a set percentage of units that qualify as affordable housing [@urban_institute_expanding_2012].[^fairfax] Figure \ref{fig:map} \label{rev:map}\revision{shows that multiracial neighborhoods in the DC area do not cluster in the city. Neighborhoods expand out not only to the inner-ring suburbs, but even middle- and outer-ring suburbs in the DC area, and } were especially likely to emerge along the hub-and-spoke system of the region's commuter rail lines in these counties [see also, @holloway_racially_2012]. Figure \ref{fig:map} \revision{reveals the value of studying a representative sample of residents living in multiracial neighborhoods given the underrepresentation of suburban neighborhoods in research on multiracial neighborhoods.}

\abouthere{Figure}{fig:map}

[^fairfax]: Fairfax County passed an inclusionary zoning ordinance in 1971, but it was struck down by the Virginia Supreme Court. Fairfax County implemented a different mandatory inclusionary zoning policy in 1990 [@silverstein_welcome_2017].

\label{rev:dc-data}\revision{The number of multiracial neighborhoods in the Washington, DC area grew substantially during this period of demographic change. Wright and colleagues} [-@wright_instability_2020]\revision{ found only four "highly diverse" neighborhoods in Washington, DC in 1990; by 2010 there were 81, and was only surpassed in number by New York and San Francisco. The number of highly diverse neighborhoods in the DC area increased by 62 percent during the 2000s while the numbers declined in nearly all other metropolitan areas with large numbers of highly diverse neighborhoods.}

## Survey Samples

Both surveys represented residents in the Washington, DC area, which was defined as Washington, DC and the surrounding jurisdictions of Montgomery and Prince George's Counties in Maryland, Arlington and Fairfax Counties Virginia (including the cities of Falls Church and Fairfax in Fairfax County), and the independent city of Alexandria, Virginia, an area that comprises 4,096,851 residents. The 2016 DC Area Survey represents residents of two types of neighborhoods: multiracial and disproportionately Latino. Analyses for this study only include responses from residents sampled in the multiracial neighborhoods. 

Multiracial neighborhoods included in the 2016 DCAS sampling frame met two criteria.[^latino-enclaves] First, neighborhoods comprised at least 10 percent Asian, Black, Latino, and white residents. The ten-percent cutoff was used to ensure that each of the four racial groups represented a distinguishable subset of a neighborhood's residents. \revision{A ten-percent cutoff has been used in previous research} [e.g., @walton_multiethnic_2016; @ellen_sharing_2000] \revision{and, given the racial diversity of the DC area, would not require the disproportionate clustering of any racial group to meet the criteria.} Second, none of those four groups could represent a majority of residents. \revision{This criterion was included to identify places that would most likely be perceived as multiracial. Since racial composition influences perceptions of place} [@krysan_perceiving_2007; @krysan_racial_2009; @krysan_cycle_2017] \revision{, the second requirement sought to avoid neighborhoods that may still be perceived to be single-race neighborhoods and has also been used as a requirement in previous research} [e.g., @farrell_no-majority_2018; @holloway_racially_2012].[^definition]

[^definition]: \revision{Wright and colleagues }[-@wright_mixed_2020] \revision{demonstrate the proliferation of definitions of multiracial neighborhoods. They show that broad conclusions about the growth and stability of multiracial neighborhoods agree across definitions, but that the specific magnitudes vary by definition.}

These criteria resulted in a sample frame of 114 neighborhoods that represented just under 585,000 people.[^one-criterion] The majority of neighborhoods were in Montgomery County, Maryland, followed by Fairfax County, Virginia, then Prince George's County, Maryland. The neighborhoods included in the sampling frame are shown in Figure \ref{fig:map}. \revision{These patterns mirror increases in Latino and Asian shares of neighborhoods documented by Pinto-Coelho and Zuberi}\label{rev:pinto-coelho} [-@pinto-coelho_segregated_2015]. An address-based sample of households was drawn from these eligible neighborhoods. The sample design included over-samples of households with Asian and Hispanic surnames and households located in from disproportionately Black tracts among those that still satisfied the criteria to be included as multiracial neighborhoods. 

[^latino-enclaves]: Disproportionately Latino neighborhoods were those in which Latino residents made up at least a quarter of the residents and were not already classified as a multiracial neighborhood.

[^one-criterion]: Eighteen neighborhoods met the first inclusion criterion but not the second. Of those eighteen, fifteen were neighborhoods that had a white majority: six were located in Fairfax County, Virginia (including one in Fairfax city), five in Montgomery County, Maryland, and two each in DC and Arlington County, Virginia. Two neighborhoods had a Black majority, one each in Montgomery County and Prince George's County. Only one neighborhood, in Montgomery County, had a Latino majority. 

Table \ref{tab:nhddescriptives} contains a comparison of multiracial neighborhoods to all neighborhoods in the DC area. White residents make up about a third of multiracial neighborhoods, on average, Latino residents make up about a quarter, Black residents make up 22 percent, and Asian residents make up 18 percent of residents. Immigration represented the largest deviation of multiracial neighborhoods from DC-area neighborhoods overall. Immigrants make up two of every five residents in multiracial neighborhoods, compared to just under one of every four residents in neighborhoods overall. Residents of multiracial neighborhoods had slightly lower educational attainment than neighborhoods overall, yet 46.6 percent had at least a bachelors degree (compared to an average of 52.3 percent of metro-wide neighborhoods), and one in five residents attained a professional degree. Married households and those with children comprised a larger share of households in multiracial neighborhoods compared to DC-area neighborhoods overall. 

\abouthere{Table}{tab:nhddescriptives}

The 2018 DC Area Survey drew a sample representative of the *entire* DC area. The sample was stratified by jurisdiction to guarantee representation of all jurisdictions in the data.[^combined] The 2018 DCAS included over-samples of tracts with disproportionately large Black and Latino populations. 

[^combined]: Arlington County and the City of Alexandria were combined into a single stratum. 

\label{rev:survey}\revision{Both surveys were administered using similar procedures. Respondents were mailed a packet with an introductory letter from the principal investigator, a 12-page questionnaire, postage-paid return envelope, and a \$2 bill as an incentive. All materials were branded with the DCAS logo. The materials were written in English, however the introductory letter had a Spanish translation on the reverse side with instructions to request a translated questionnaire. A single reminder was sent approximately half way through each six-week field period. In addition to asking about neighborhoods, the surveys both asked about respondents' health, perceptions of crime, interaction with police, and political attitudes. Although the two surveys differed, the dependent variables in the analysis all came from the first page, and the first pages of the two surveys were very similar across the two surveys. The response rates were 12.8 percent and 12.2 percent for the DCAS 2016 and DCAS 2018 surveys} [RR4, @american_association_of_public_opinion_researchers_standard_2008].

## Dependent Variable

The analyses used a dichotomous measure of neighborhood satisfaction. Both surveys asked respondents, "How satisfied are you with your neighborhood as a place to live?," a question that has been used in previous research [see, e.g., @greif_intersection_2015; @woldoff_effects_2002]. Respondents who indicated that they were "extremely" or "very" satisfied living in their neighborhood were coded as being satisfied. Those who indicated that they were "somewhat" or "not at all" satisfied were coded as being unsatisfied.

## Independent Variable
Respondents' self-identified race and ethnicity was the independent variable in all analyses. I classified racial groups into four mutually exclusive categories based on the respondents' answers to questions about Hispanic ethnicity and race (respondents were allowed to choose multiple racial groups). I classified those respondents who indicated Hispanic ethnicity as *Latino*, regardless of their race. Among the remaining non-Latino respondents, I classified as *white* those who selected white as their only race; as *Black* those identified as Black, either alone or in combination with any other race; and as *Asian* those who identified as Asian or Pacific Islander, either alone or in combination with any race other than Black. Respondents missing on either the race question or the ethnicity question and respondents who did not satisfy the criteria above were not included in the analysis. This left a final analytic dataset of 641 respondents in the 2016 data and 989 respondents in the 2018 data.

## Control Variables
I included variables to control for other demographic characteristics of residents. I calculated *age* based on respondents' birth year and *gender* based on respondents' gender identity, for which they were given the choices "male," "female," and "other." Female was set as the reference. Only two respondents chose "other" and were coded as missing on this question. I included an indicator for *being partnered* based on those respondents who indicated that they were "now married or in a marriage-style arrangement," with those not currently partnered as the reference.

I included whether the respondent had *children in the household* because the presence of children could affect the outlook residents have of their neighborhoods. The question did not limit the response to respondents' own children. I also included an indicator to measure whether respondents were *foreign born* since immigrant status would likely correlate with residential perceptions and race simultaneously.

I represented socioeconomic status with a measure of *educational attainment*. I created a measure with five categories based on the highest level of education respondents reported: less than high school, high school (including GED), some college (including associates degrees), bachelors degree, and graduate degree. I chose to use educational attainment to measure socioeconomic status because it is a more stable measure than income, and space did not permit the DCAS to ascertain income longitudinally. Income also had more missing data in both 2016 (N=59) and 2018 (N=79) compared to educational attainment (N=15 in 2016 and N=25 in 2018). Among those respondents who answered both questions, however, education and income were highly correlated.

I also included measures of neighborhood experience that account for neighborhood lifecourse characteristics. First, I included the *years respondents lived in their neighborhoods* since the lifecourse model presumes that people will become accustomed to the norms and will become more satisfied as they live in the neighborhood over a longer period. Second, I included a measure of *neighborhood size*. This measure was self-reported by respondents and including it in models accounts for how subjective perceptions of neighborhood boundaries affect satisfaction and perceived change. Statistics describing the multiracial neighborhood sample of the 2016 DCAS data are reported in Table \ref{tab:descriptives16}, and statistics describing the sample of the complete DC-area population from the 2018 DCAS data are reported in Table \ref{tab:descriptives18}.

## Analytical Approach

I used logistic regression analysis to test the hypotheses above. The general model is expressed in the equation:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{\eta} = \alpha + \mathbf{\beta^T X} + \mathbf{\gamma^T Z} + \mathbf{\delta_j}
\label{eqn:model}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\mathbf{\eta}$ is the vector of outcomes for respondents transformed using a logistic link function. In the model, $\alpha$ measures the intercept, and $\mathbf{\beta}$ is a vector of point estimates for racial groups (with whites omitted). White respondents were selected as the reference group since the hypotheses ask whether white perceptions differ from the perceptions of other racial groups. The vector $\mathbf{\gamma}$ contains point estimates of demographic and neighborhood experience controls, $\mathbf{Z}$. 

Analyses based exclusively on the 2016 data of residents living in multiracial neighborhoods included a fixed effect, $\mathbf{\delta_j}$, for the neighborhood of residence. Neighborhoods were defined as residents' census tracts. The median neighborhood included five respondents and the maximum reached twenty residents. Nine neighborhoods had only a single respondent. The nine respondents from these neighborhoods were dropped from analyses that included fixed effects. Including neighborhood fixed effects makes the estimates, $\mathbf{\beta}$, reflect the differences between white outcomes and those of Asian, Black, and Latino residents *living in the same neighborhood*. 

All analyses were conducted in R (version 3.6.3), and they all accounted for missing data and the complex survey design. I used the `Amelia` package [@honaker_amelia_2011] to impute missing values in five datasets. I conducted all analyses using these five datasets weighting outcomes to account for the complex sample design using the `survey` library [@lumley_analysis_2004]. I combined all results using Rubin's [-@rubin_multiple_2004] rules. A replication package that includes all data and code used for the models is available at \[redacted\].

# Results

## Internal Satisfaction

The first analysis examined satisfaction among residents living in multiracial neighborhoods in the DC Area. Consistent with the the shared satisfaction perspective, I found that little variation exists within multiracial neighborhoods. Table \ref{tab:descwn} reports the percentage of residents who expressed satisfaction living in multiracial neighborhoods by racial group as well as differences among groups. The first column shows that a large majority of all residents, 71.3 percent, were satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods. It further shows few differences by race. Latino residents had the largest deviation from the overall mean, but that deviation was only 3.7 percentage points. Furthermore, the largest difference between any two groups, Black and Latino residents, was only 6.2 percentage points.  

\abouthere{Table}{tab:descwn}

Regression analyses further confirmed the lack of interracial variation in neighborhood satisfaction. Table \ref{tab:within} reports the results estimating three models. All three models included a fixed effect for the neighborhood (tract) of residence that allows the estimates to be interpreted as racial differences among residents living in the same neighborhood. 

\abouthere{Table}{tab:within}

The first model included only race and the neighborhood fixed effects. The parameter estimates confirm minimal differences by race. The average marginal effects and 95 percent confidence intervals of this model, expressed as percentages of each group predicted to report being satisfied, are shown in Figure \ref{fig:within}. The average marginal effect measuring the difference in the probability of being satisfied compared to white residents of multiracial neighborhoods was -0.8 percent for Asian residents, 5.3 percent for Black residents, and 3.1 percent for Latino residents. 

\abouthere{Figure}{fig:within}

Adjusting for other characteristics contributed very small increases to the interracial variation. The estimated average marginal effects measuring the difference in probability of being satisfied compared to white residents in the full model (also plotted in Figure \ref{fig:within}) increased to 0.6 percent among Asian residents, 6.0 percent among Black residents, and 6.7 percent among Latino residents. The adjusted coefficients confirm that race does little to predict variation in neighborhood satisfaction.

The final row of Table \ref{tab:within} shows further evidence against interracial differences in neighborhood satisfaction among residents of multiracial neighborhoods. The row reports the Akaike information criterion (AIC), a measure that balances a model’s parsimony with its goodness of fit to the data [@akaike_new_1974]. Lower values indicate better fit, and the results show that the data fit a model without race (reported in the third column) better than a model including race (reported in the second column). Wald-F statistics across all imputed datasets confirm that the data fit the model that excluded race better than the model that included race.

These findings provide evidence that residents of all races are equally satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods. White residents, among whom the racial stratification theories would predict to be dissatisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods, were just as satisfied as their neighbors of color. What is more, a large majority of all four racial groups, ranging from 68.3 to 75.1 percent, reported being satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods. The widespread level of satisfaction among all four racial groups supports the shared satisfaction model of multiracial integration. 

\revision{Due to the cross-sectional source of data, the selection of diversity-seeking residents into multiracial neighborhoods and dissatisfied residents out of multiracial neighborhoods may undermine the conclusion of shared satisfaction, especially among white residents. I conducted robustness analyses to look for evidence of selection.}[^internal-robustness] \revision{I first examined whether longer-term white residents were less satisfied than those who recently moved into neighborhoods. I did not find evidence that longer-term white residents were less satisfied, a finding that we would have expected if long-term white residents were stuck in place without options to move out. I then examined whether losing larger shares of whites affected interracial levels of satisfaction. The multiracial neighborhoods I sampled may have been neighborhoods in transition, changing from one composition to another. If so, then whites leaving would undermine the basis for concluding that a sense of shared satisfaction existed. I did not, however, find any interracial differences in satisfaction among neighborhoods that had lost larger shares of whites over the previous 15 years. Although only longitudinal data from respondents can decisively answer the question, these robustness analyses provide evidence consistent with the conclusion that selection does not exert a strong influence on shared satisfaction.}\label{rev:internal}

## Comparative Satisfaction

I compared the difference between neighborhood satisfaction among residents of multiracial neighborhoods to neighborhood satisfaction among residents in general. In particular, I focused on comparisons between same-race residents. The traditional theories of neighborhood change predict lower satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods. Recall, however, that two separate hypotheses predict different patterns: Putnam's -@putnam_e_2007 constrict theory predicts lower satisfaction among all racial groups while Abascal and Baldassarri -@abascal_love_2015 white exceptionalism predicts lower satisfaction only among whites. In contrast to both, the strongest form of the shared satisfaction perspective predicts that residents of multiracial neighborhoods will be as satisfied as residents elsewhere in the region. To examine these hypotheses, I compared estimates of a model using the multiracial sample from the 2016 DCAS to estimates that used the DC area-wide sample from the 2018 DCAS. I used the model in Equation \ref{eqn:model} without neighborhood fixed-effects. 

Table \ref{tab:descbn} shows neighborhood satisfaction among residents of the DC area. Among residents of the entire DC area, 78.3 percent were satisfied in their neighborhoods. Consistent with the social disorganization hypothesis, the percentage was 7.6 percentage points higher than satisfaction felt among residents of multiracial neighborhoods ($p{<}0.05$ from a two-sample t-test). But Table \ref{tab:descbn} also shows that the lower satisfaction levels can be largely attributed to white residents. White residents of multiracial neighborhoods were 16.2 percent less likely to be satisfied with their neighborhoods than white residents in the DC area ($p{<}0.001$). Asian residents of multiracial neighborhoods were also less likely to be satisfied than DC-area Asian residents, but the difference was insufficiently large to be confident that it did not arise from sampling variation ($p{=}0.200$). Black multiracial neighborhood residents were 2.1 percentage points less likely to be satisfied than Black DC-area residents generally, while Latinos were about equally likely to be satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods as elsewhere in the DC area. 

\abouthere{Table}{tab:descbn}

The pattern of lower satisfaction among whites held after controlling for other demographic and neighborhood characteristics. Figure \ref{fig:between} shows the predicted value of neighborhood satisfaction for different racial groups from a model estimated separately from the multiracial neighborhood sample and the complete DC-area sample. I calculated the predictions at the mean value of each control variable in the metropolitan-wide (i.e., DCAS 2018) sample.[^MEM] The plot shows a clear difference in satisfaction between white people living in multiracial neighborhoods and white people in the DC area, and it shows small differences for the other racial groups. The share of Asian residents satisfied in multiracial neighborhoods was only 3.5 percentage points lower than the share of satisfied DC-area Asian residents. Almost no difference existed between Black residents of multiracial neighborhoods and Black residents overall. Latino residents of multiracial neighborhoods were *more likely* to be satisfied than Latinos overall after controlling for individual characteristics. 

\abouthere{Figure}{fig:between}

[^MEM]: These marginal effects at the mean (MEM) differ from the average marginal effect (AME) plotted in Figure \ref{fig:within}. The MEM allows the comparisons to be made at comparable values across the two datasets with substantially different marginal distributions.

The results cast doubt on the universality of the Putnam's -@putnam_e_2007 constrict theory. Black and Latino residents of multiracial neighborhoods were equally or more satisfied than their counterparts elsewhere in the metropolitan area. Even among Asians, the difference between multiracial neighborhood residents and metropolitan residents was small after controlling for individual characteristics. Only among whites did living in a multiracial neighborhood predict lower levels of satisfaction. The result affirms Abascal and Baldassarri's -@abascal_love_2015 prediction of white exceptionalism. In addition to providing evidence against the constrict theory, the results also cast doubt on the strongest view of the shared satisfaction perspective that white residents find as much satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods as other neighborhoods.[^entropy] 

[^entropy]: \revision{I also analyzed the association between entropy and satisfaction among groups using only the DC area-wide data from the DCAS 2018. The results were consistent with the findings presented in Figure} \ref{fig:between}. \revision{I also examined differences between residents of multiracial neighborhoods and all DC-area residents based on a combined model, and those results were also consistent with the results presented in Figure} \ref{fig:between}. \revision{These analyses can be viewed on pages} \pageref{rob:entropy}--\pageref{rob:lntotchg-all} \revision{of the supplement.}


## Internal Perceptions of Neighborhood Change

Lower satisfaction among white residents living in multiracial neighborhoods creates a particularly disconcerting situation if they were concerned that the changes caused neighborhood quality to decline. The final analysis, of internal perceptions of change, addresses this concern. Traditional urban theories predict that a large share, if not a majority, of white residents will perceive their neighborhood as declining after it integrates. The shared satisfaction perspective, predicts the opposite. 

The 2016 DCAS asked for responses to the prompt, "Looking back over the past five years or so, would you say that your neighborhood has...," and allowed respondents to choose from five responses: become a much better (worse) place to live, become a somewhat better (worse) place to live, or stayed about the same. I recoded responses into three categories representing whether respondents reported their neighborhoods getting better, getting worse, or staying the same. Because this was one of the first questions asked on the survey, and because it came before any questions about the respondent's own race or racial attitudes, respondents were not primed to think about neighborhood changes in the context of racial change. 

Overall, 34.5 percent of all residents living in multiracial neighborhoods thought that their neighborhoods improved over the previous five years. In contrast, only 11.5 percent of residents thought that their neighborhoods got worse. Just over half, 54.0 percent thought that the neighborhood stayed the same. Figure \ref{fig:change} plots, by race, the unadjusted percentage of residents living in multiracial neighborhoods that think that their neighborhoods have gotten better, gotten worse, or stayed the same. Black and Latino residents were as likely as white residents to report that multiracial neighborhoods have gotten worse, contrary to the theoretical expectation that white residents would perceive neighborhood declines. In all three cases, the percentage of respondents who perceived declining neighborhood conditions was small. 

\abouthere{Figure}{fig:change}

White residents were, however, less likely to think that their neighborhoods improved: only 26.9 percent reported that their neighborhoods improved while 60.4 percent believed that the neighborhood stayed the same. In comparison, 37.8 percent of Asian residents, 36.9 percent of Black residents, and 39.5 percent of Latino residents reported that their neighborhoods improved. Controls in a regression model did not account for white residents' lower propensity to perceive neighborhood improvement in multiracial neighborhoods. Table \ref{tab:change} reports estimates of two models predicting perceptions of neighborhood change, a race-only model and a model that includes the complement of controls, including neighborhood fixed effects. Racial differences diminished only slightly in the models that included controls. The average marginal effects of race on neighborhood improvement compared to white residents were 13.8 percent for Black residents ($p{=}0.006$), 14.4 percent for Latino residents ($p{=}0.010$), and 10.5 percent for Asian residents ($p{=}0.033$) based on the full model. The data fit the model that includes race better than the model that does not.[^multinomial]

\abouthere{Table}{tab:change}

[^multinomial]: A multinomial model supported the absence of racial variation in negative evaluations of neighborhood change. The results did not show a statistically significant effect of racial identity (at conventional levels) in evaluating the neighborhood as having improved, either. The multinomial models, however, have very large standard errors because the models included neighborhood fixed-effects for 112 neighborhoods in each of two outcomes. The results of the multinomial models are included in the supplement. 

That a smaller share of white residents perceive improvement than their neighborhoods of color deserves context in light of theories of urban development. Although a smaller share of white residents see neighborhood improvements compared to residents of color, a *majority* of white residents perceive no change. And, a quarter of white residents do perceive improvement. These results provide a strong counterclaim against traditional urban theories that predict white disgruntlement with integration. While the results do not fully support the shared satisfaction model of integration, where whites view changes as positively as neighbors of color, the balance of the results fall closer to shared satisfaction than white antipathy. 

# Discussion & Conclusions

## Shared Satisfaction Among Residents of Multiracial Neighborhoods
Multiracial neighborhoods have become a feature of many US metropolitan areas, and this study asked whether residents find satisfaction living in them. I examined this topic with, to my knowledge, the first representative sample of residents living in multiracial neighborhoods in a metropolitan area. Among residents from over 100 multiracial neighborhoods across an entire metropolitan region, I found that 71 percent of residents were satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods, and that satisfaction *did not vary* by race. This evidence supports the shared satisfaction perspective of multiracial integration, and it undermines the premise of traditional urban theories that predict distrust and social disorganization. 

The analysis of comparative satisfaction, however, tempers the strongest interpretation of shared satisfaction. The strongest interpretation posits that satisfaction rates would equal those of other neighborhoods, an interpretation that holds among Black and Latino residents and likely holds among Asian residents. The interpretation, however, does not hold among whites. My evidence concurs with past research that only whites experience lower levels of satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods [c.f., @abascal_love_2015; @van_der_meer_ethnic_2014]. Yet evidence of white antipathy predicted by traditional theories also seems unlikely since more than three-fifths of white residents in multiracial neighborhoods perceive no change in neighborhood quality and 26 percent view changes positively. Cumulatively, these findings support the shared satisfaction perspective while revealing topics for future research that I describe more below. 

## Multiracial Neighborhoods as Leveling Structures

Multiracial neighborhoods might offer a structure that levels satisfaction rates across the metropolitan population. Given the racist development of metropolitan neighborhoods, it might be no surprise that white satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods is lower than that of white residents in the DC area at large. Opportunity hoarding among whites, especially middle-class whites, mean that predominantly white neighborhoods tend to have a surfeit of economic, cultural, and political resources.[^opportunity-hoarding] Like elsewhere in the country, whiter neighborhoods in the DC area have higher property values, schools with better reputations, and more access to amenities. White residents in the area-wide comparison group acquire disproportionate access to these resources and, possibly as a result, end up more satisfied. White residents of multiracial neighborhoods, in contrast, may end up confronting the lower levels of access that people of color typically experience. 

[^opportunity-hoarding]: \label{rev:hoarding}\revision{A few examples of opportunity hoarding in the past five years include opposing school district boundary changes for fear of property value declines in one district and shouting down researchers at an event planning for \emph{potential} redistricting plans in another one }[@woolsey_opposition_2019; @peetz_this_2019]\revision{, opposing homeless shelter locations in wealthy and disproportionately white wards of the city on the basis that if "homeless lives matter; the lives of community homeowners matter too" }[@alpert_upper_2016] \revision{, and fiercely opposing zoning changes in single-family neighborhoods }[@koma_valors_2020]. 

Preferences for integration might also explain why larger shares of Asian, Black, and Latino residents perceive neighborhood improvement compared to whites. Past research shows that all three groups profess stronger preferences for integration than whites [@charles_neighborhood_2000; @bader_community_2015]. Until recently, whites overwhelmingly rejected integration [@charles_wont_2006; @krysan_diversity_2017]. That neighborhood integration precipitated neutral feelings rather than negative feelings in this study reflects a marked contrast to traditional theories of racial integration. 

In summary, multiracial neighborhoods may level access to resources and, as a result, level perceptions of satisfaction. The comparative analysis deserves future research, \revision{especially since the dispersion of respondents across neighborhoods in the DC-area-wide data limited my ability to assess the impact on residents experiencing the same neighborhood changes. Changes to racial attitudes since the 1980s suggest that updating Hipp's }[-@hipp_specifying_2009]\revision{ analysis would be a fruitful endeavor, as would collecting and analyzing data on satisfaction with respondents clustered at the neighborhood level} [e.g., @greif_intersection_2015].\label{rev:comparative-conclusions}

\revision{Research investigating contemporary spatial inequality should help to refine estimates of neighborhood satisfaction across neighborhoods with different racial compositions}, especially given the implications for redistributive policies. Although whites may be less satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods than in other neighborhoods, they end up with a similar level of satisfaction felt by other racial groups in the metropolitan area. Changes that occurred in multiracial neighborhoods improve the neighborhoods in the eyes of people of color while not diminishing neighborhoods in 87 percent of whites. That integration occurs while invoking  among most whites a neutral or positive sentiment about changes in their neighborhoods indicates that integration does not impose too substantial of a cost on their enjoyment of neighborhoods. 

The belief that whites end up dissatisfied when living in integrated neighborhoods has stymied progress toward policies promoting integration. The results of this study combined with the previous literature should alleviate concerns of white dissatisfaction since an equal-sized majority of all racial groups find satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods. Policymakers may wish to start by affirmatively marketing multiracial neighborhoods. Knowledge about neighborhoods tends to differ by race [@krysan_racial_2009; @krysan_cycle_2017], and lower familiarity with specific multiracial neighborhoods might prevent movers from searching in them. Affirmative marketing campaigns can market the shared sense of satisfaction when they feature multiracial neighborhoods. 

At the same time, multiracial neighborhoods do not constitute a panacea. Racial integration requires trading off benefits and costs [@bell_silent_2005]. There are good reasons to support further racial integration, but integration itself does not represent an unalloyed good. People of color, and Black people in particular, are already aware of the trade-offs and have been negotiating these trade-offs for decades [@lacy_blue-chip_2007; @lewis-mccoy_inequality_2014; @lewis_race_2003]. Integration promotes a sense of the "real world," but also exposes them to the daily incivilities and danger of racism [@lacy_blue-chip_2007; @spitz_segregated_2015]. \revision{"Habits of whiteness" } [@walton_habits_2021] \revision{can become the default normative behavior that can marginalize residents of color.}\label{rev:habits} Policies that promote racial integration should also attend to the inclusion and access of residents living in those spaces. That shared satisfaction exists in multiracial neighborhoods does not, however, preclude the possibility that bi-racial integration leads to declining satisfaction and animosity. Future research should investigate satisfaction in different types of integrated neighborhoods. \revision{Relatedly, as Greif's }[-@greif_intersection_2015]\revision{ work has demonstrated the importance of intraracial influence of neighborhood change on satisfaction and should be incorporated into future work }[see also @lacy_blue-chip_2007; @woldoff_white_2011].

## Improving Theories of Urban Change Based on Shared Satisfaction
The evidence in this article shows that, on balance, future research should investigate why multiracial neighborhoods sustain equal rates of satisfaction among residents across racial groups. While racial groups all find satisfaction, they might do so for different reasons. Knowing which amenities appeal to different groups will be important to understand the prospects for stable multiracial integration and must be part of policies that support multiracial integration. 

Research should also further investigate perceptions among whites. As I note above, racial antipathy appears unlikely in multiracial neighborhoods. Yet, lower satisfaction than whites in the metropolitan region and the less positive views of change than their neighbors reveals a lower level of enthusiasm. Whites might tire of negotiating racial differences in their communities. The work required (that whites have expected people of color to perform in white neighborhoods) could exhaust or frustrate white residents. The results in this study do not provide an answer; the results suggest that a perspective premised on interracial shared satisfaction might find greater success than one that presumes social disorganization. 

DC differs from other metropolitan areas in ways that might increase the chance of satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods. The DC area includes the first jurisdictions to experiment with inclusive zoning policies that contribute to racial integration. In addition, the DC area ranks at the top or among the top metropolitan areas for educational attainment among Black and Latino residents, while drawing immigrants from across the economic spectrum. All of these factors may help residents of multiracial neighborhoods build bonds across race more easily.[^identification] \label{rev:dc-conclusions}\revision{Simultaneously, knowledge-based and high-end service sectors of the economy have grown. These factors may be why the DC region ranks among those with the most multiracial neighborhoods. But they are similar to other metropolitan areas that have seen similar increases in multiracial neighborhoods including Sacramento, Seattle, and Dallas }[@wright_instability_2020]. \revision{As the number of multiracial neighborhoods has increased, the need for comparative analyses of internal dynamics of multiracial neighborhoods across metropolitan areas has gone unmet.}

[^identification]: While these factors might limit the generalizability of findings from the DC area, they also helped isolate racial effects in the data since race does not correlate as strongly with educational attainment and immigration in the DC area as it does in other metropolitan areas. 

Finally, the DC area suggests that studies of *suburban* integration should also be a priority. The suburbs contain almost all of the multiracial neighborhoods in the DC area. Although a larger share of multiracial neighborhoods might exist in the DC area compared to other metropolitan areas, several recent studies document the suburban expansion of multiracial neighborhoods [@holloway_racially_2012]. These neighborhoods are rarely known as multiracial neighborhoods, if they are known at all, and might provide unique insight into contemporary racial dynamics. 

This article finds that a large share of residents are satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods and, more importantly, that Asian, Black, Latino, and white residents express satisfaction in equal proportions. This study contributes to a growing literature that shows that residents across races share similar levels of satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods. It does so using a study representative of residents in multiracial neighborhoods that allows the claim to be more general than past studies allowed. Multiracial neighborhoods, especially those in the suburbs, should be studied more frequently to explain the contemporary relationship between race and place. In doing so, studies will likely break with traditional theories of racial change in ways that may promote racial equity.

<!-- ## Data Construction

The following plot shows the high degree of correlation between respondent educational attainment and income in the DCAS 2016 sample. The high level of correlation and the larger share of missingness on income led me to use educational attainment to measure socioeconomic status rather than using income or both educational attainment and income.

## Internal Satisfaction Robustness Analysis{#rob:internal}

The data from the DCAS 2016 raise the issue that I, by construction, only received responses from residents selected on two types of behaviors: residents who chose not to move out of multiracial neighborhoods and residents who selected to move into multiracial neighborhoods. Residents may have exhibited one or both of these behaviors. These residents might exhibit different levels of satisfaction that either those who left or chose not to move into multiracial neighborhoods. Given the importance of selection effects, and the importance of selection of whites in particular based on the predictions of existing theories, I conducted analyses to mitigate concerns about selection effects among whites. The first analyses examine levels of satisfaction among whites by duration of residence and the second examine interracial differences by the size of white population change in neighborhoods. 

#### Influence of length of residence on satisfaction

The first robustness analysis considers length of residence in neighborhoods by race. One element of selection would exist if whites were so disinterested in moving to multiracial neighborhoods that no new whites moved in. If this were true, then multiracial integration would be the exclusive result of incumbents remaining in integrated neighborhoods. 

![Distribution of years lived in current neighborhood by race](../analysis/images/supp-nhdyears-race.png){#fig:supp-nhdyrs-race}

Figure @fig:supp-nhdyrs-race shows evidence against the dynamic of total white avoidance. Figure @fig:supp-nhdyrs-race plots the distribution of years lived in their current neighborhood by the race of the respondent. While it is true that whites exclusively account for residents who have lived in neighborhoods longer than 40 years, *about half of white respondents* moved into multiracial neighborhoods in the past 10 years. The mixture of long-term and short-term white residents does not suggest that neighborhoods have become anathema to whites as they have become more integrated. Of DCAS 2016 respondents who had moved into their neighborhoods in the previous 10 years, 29 percent were white (in fact, approximately equal shares of newcomers identified by each race: 23 percent were Asian, 26 percent were Black, and 22 percent were Latinx).

Previous theories and evidence suggest that the white residents who have stayed in multiracial neighborhoods will be some mixture of: 

#. white residents who have been satisfied living in integrated neighborhoods and chose not to leave (satisfied stayers), and 
#. white residents who have been stuck in the neighborhood without the means to move out of the neighborhood despite being dissatisified (dissatisfied stayers). 

The latter subgroup, the "dissatisfied stayers" would perceive neighbohroods similarly to those who were dissatisfied *and* able to leave. Meanwhile, previous theories and evidence do not provide a strong reason that the former subgroup, the "satisfied stayers," would have higher levels of satisfaction than new white entrants who selected multiracial neighborhoods above other neighborhood types. Without a reason to suspect that stayers would, on average, be more satisfied than the average new entrant, and stayers comprise both those satisfied and those dissatisfied with integration, then evidence of lower satisfaction among longer-term residents would provide some evidence that selection by satisfaction level has been occurring. 

Figure @fig:supp-satisfied-years-whites shows the (unweighted) smoothed percent of white residents satisified by length of residence in their neighborhoods. Given the importance of white residents to the theories, and the fact that the neighborhoods in the sample were almost all predominantly white neighborhoods that integrated over time, I focus on white respondents. Just under 70 percent of whites who lived in the neighborhood fewer than 40 years reported being satisfied, with a possible modest increase among those who lived in the neighborhood from 10 to 20 years. A consistent downward trend existed among the five percent of white residents who lived in the neighborhood for at least 40 years (but even then, more of those residents were satisfied than dissatisfied). 

![Satisfaction by length of residence among white resdients in multiracial neighborhoods](../analysis/images/supp-nhwsat.pdf){#fig:supp-satisfied-years-whites}

The descriptive plot above does not, however, account for other factors that might correlate with satisfaction and length of residents, especially age, which mechanically correlates with length of residence. I created models that include a categorical variable for how long respondents have lived in multiracial neighborhoods and estimated parameters based only among white respondents. 

The results of these models are reported in Table \ref{tab:nhwyrs} below. The first two columns report estimates of models with neighborhood fixed effects, meaning the models statistically compare white residents living in the same neighborhood. The first column shows that length of residence *does not* predict satisfaction among whites. The coefficients for residents who lived longer in their neighborhoods were negative, but the standard errors were double the estimated point estimates for two of three cases and as large as the point estimate for the third. What is more, the data fit the model without length of residence better than the model that included length of residence, evidence of which can be seen in the smaller AIC in the second column compared to the first. 

\input{../analysis/tables/supp-nhwyrs.tex}

The third and fourth columns report analogous models without fixed effects. Removing the fixed effects and not including any neighborhood covariates allowed me to examine whether the duration of residence between any two white residents randomly drawn from any multiracial neighborhood in the DC Area differ from one another. Not accounting for different neighborhood conditions allowed any trends in satisfaction between newcomers and incumbents to be observed, even if those conditions were the result of neighborhood conditions. Accordingly, it provided a conservative estimate regarding the association between duration and neighborhoods and satisfaction. As with the first two models, none of the coefficients can be distinguished from a null association and the data fit the model without length of residence better than the model with length of residence. Given existing the existing theories regarding neighborhood selection, these results provide evidence that mitigate concerns that selection effects undermine the share of satisfied white residents living in multiracial neighborhoods. 

#### Influence of white population change

The second analysis examined whether white residents were systematically less likely than other racial to be satisfied in neighborhoods that tended to lose more whites. The loss of whites could signal dissatisfaction as whites "vote with their feet" and move out of the neighborhood. In addition, the loss of white neighbors could lead white residents who remain to feel less satisfied with their neighborhoods. Existing theories would predict that whites would be more sensitive to the loss of white residents than other racial groups, so we would expect to see larger interracial disparities in neighborhoods that lost more whites. 

To address the possibility that white losses affect satisfaction differently for whites than other groups, I stratified the data by the white population change that occurred in the neighborhood from 2000 to 2015 (the latter being based on the 2011-2015 Five-year American Community Survey estimates). To account for different neighborhood sizes, I calculated the ratio of whites living in the neighborhood in 2015 to the number of whites who lived in the neighborhood in 2000; I then took the natural log of this value (i.e., $\ln(\text{POP}_{2015}/\text{POP}_{2000})$) to obtain a linear variable to include in models. 

I  calculated tertiles of change based on the distribution of white population change in neighborhoods.[^tertiles] The average neighborhood kept 80 out of every 100 of its white residents (median = 78 out of 100). The bands for the white population ratio in each tertile reported in Table @tbl:tertiles and are depicted in orange in Figure @fig:supp-chgtert.

[^tertiles]: I based the tertiles on the unique neighborhoods in the data. The tertiles have different numbers of residents based on the varying number of residents in each neighborhood. 

Table: Values of white population change ratio ranges by tertiles {#tbl:tertiles}

Tertile   Range of change ratio
--------- -----------------------
First     0.21-0.71
Second    0.71-0.88
Third     0.88-3.42

Table @tbl:tertiles and @fig:supp-chgtert show considerable variation in how much white population change occurred in multiracial neighborhoods. Some neighborhoods lost a large number of whites, but even in the tertile representing the largest white losses, the upper limit of neighborhoods kept 71 percent of white residents. This value is consistent with average annual mobility rates among whites, which in 2010 were 10.0 percent [@us_census_bureau_geographical_2011]. Although multiracial neighborhoods in the data lost whites, there were still 20 percent of neighborhoods that *gained* white residents over 15 years. The data used in the manuscript, therefore, reflect neighborhoods with a large distribution of white population losses and gains. These descriptive analysies show that the data used in the manuscript, therefore, reflect neighborhoods with a large distribution of white population losses and gains. 

![Distribution of neighborhood white population change](../analysis/images/supp-chgtert.pdf){#fig:supp-chgtert}

To examine whether interracial differences in satisfaction were consistent across this distribution of white neighborhood change, I stratified the DCAS 2016 by tertiles and re-estimated Models 2 and 3 from Table 6 of the manuscript. The parameter estimates, standard errors, and AIC values for the models are reported in Table \ref{tab:chgtert}. Model 2 in each of the tertiles includes race as a predictor of satisfaction. No effect exists that can be statistically distinguished from the null in any of the three models. In the two lowest tertiles, the data fit Model 3, which does not include race, than they fit Model 2. The data for the highest tertile fit the model that includes race better than the model that does not, but none of the race coefficients approach statistical significance.

### Summary of internal satisfaction robustness analyses 

While the analyses above cannot definitively reject selection effects, they mitigate concerns that selection effects are responsible for finding shared satisfaction among residents in multiracial neighborhoods. Among whites---the group that previous research suggests would be the most likely to be affected by integration---the inclusion of the variable measuring length of residence did not improve the fit of the model. About half of white residents moved into multiracial neighborhoods in the past 10 years. They were not more satisfied than whites who moved into multiracial neighborhoods 20, 30, or 40 years prior. Although the data cannot disprove the exit of dissatisfied white residents, the results provide evidence that the share of satisfied long-term white residents are similar to white newcomers. Evidence against selection effects was further bolstered by the fact that interracial differences in satisfaction were not systematically related to white losses in multiracial neighborhoods. Whites were not less likely than other groups to be satisfied in neighborhoods that lost more whites. 

Together, these findings provide some assurance that selection effects are not solely responsible for shared satisfaction. Further data that measures satisfaction among people over time would, of course, provide data to answer the question. Even without these data, however, these results provide evidence of shared satisfaction among *current* residents, regardless of how they ended up living in multiracial neighborhoods. 

## Comparative Satisfaction Robustness Analysis{#rob:comparative}

I also conducted three supplemental analyses to confirm the plausibility of the findings in the comparative analysis. The comparative analysis examined satisfaction levels, by race, between residents of multiracial neighborhoods and residents of DC-area neighborhoods generally. The findings reported in the article showed that a larger proportion of whites were satisfied living in the DC area neighborhoods relative to whites living in multiracial nieghborhoods while satisfaction levels were similar for non-white racial groups. I first analyzed whether neighborhood racial diversity predicted satisfaction among the DCAS 2018 sample and what effect a changing white population had on residents in both samples. 

#### Satisfaction in DC area by neighborhood entropy.{#rob:entropy}

One way to approach the between-neighborhood analysis reported in Figure 3 of the manuscript is to analyze the influence of racial composition on the sample that represents all DC-area residents using the DCAS 2018 data. The DCAS 2018 data, which represented residents in the entire DC area, offered an opportunity to assess the influence of multiracial diversity on satisfaction across the DC area. The between neighborhood analysis showed:

#. satisfaction among white residents of multiracial neighborhoods is lower than satisfaction among white residents in general; and
#. satisfaction does not differ between residents of multiracial and other neighborhoods among Black, Latinx, and Asian residents in the DC area.

I use entropy to measure racial integration. Entropy reaches its maximum when each group makes up an equal share of residents in a neighborhood. Entropy offers a useful measure of multiracial diversity, however it does not account for differences between racial compositions at the same level of entropy (an all-white and all-Black neighborhood would, for example, both have entropy scores of zero). An alternative would be to categorize neighborhoods by presence of racial groups. Unfortunately sample sizes within different categories of racial composition do not allow me to meaningfully compare neighborhoods by composition. In addition to approaching the comparitive satisfaction differently, the analysis allowed me to ascertain the validity of the internal satisfaction associations found in the manuscript (i.e., Tables 5 & 6 and Figure 2 in the manuscript). 

I centered entropy around the mean value of neighborhood entropy among DCAS 2016 respondents (H=1.27 out of a maximum of 1.39) and rescaled the variable so that values equal standard deviations based on all DC-area neighborhoods. Centering around the mean neighborhood included in the DCAS 2016 value allowed the intercept of the model to equal the average exposure used to predict values in Figure 3. I estimated two models, one that included entropy as an independent variable and a second that included interactions between entropy and respondent race. 

The estimated values of both models can be found in Table \ref{tab:entropy}. The model that includes the interaction between the race of resident with neighborhood entropy is consistent with the findings reported in Figure 3. At the mean level of entropy in multiracial neighborhoods, Model (2) predicts that 76 percent of white residents would be satisfied (95% confidence interval: \[58, 88\]), while 84 percent of white residents with the average white exposure in the DC area would be satisfied (95% confidence interval: \[73, 91\]). The respective corresponding values of white satisfaction reported in Figure 3 were 70 and 83 percent. The association of entropy on satisfaction among whites did not have an association statistically distinguishable from the null, despite the point estimate being relatively large.

\input{../analysis/tables/supp-entropy.tex}

Entropy had almost no influence on the satisfaction expressed by Black and Latino respondents. A one standard deviation decrease in entropy only reduced the odds of satisfaction among Black residents 0.78 (p $\approx$ 0.07) times and among Latinx residents 0.66 (p $\approx$ 0.16) times. Asian residents appeared to be more satisfied in less diverse neighborhoods; the odds of an Asian resident being satisfied were 2.4 times higher for each standard deviation decrease in entropy and were marginally significant (p $\approx$ 0.93). 

Finally, Model (1) shows that white DC-area residents were more likely to be satisfied living in their neighborhoods than Asian, Black, and Latinx residents. The coefficients for Asian, Black, and Latinx respondents were negative in the model, though the difference from white residents was only statistically significant for Black residents despite relatively large coefficients for Asian and Latinx residents. Controlling for the interaction of race by entropy almost eliminated differences between whites and both Black and Latinx residents when entropy equaled the mean level found in multiracial neighborhoods.

In summary, this supplemental analysis shows:

#. that whites are less satisfied in multiracial neighborhoods with some possibility that the difference reflects a statistical artifact (roughly consistent with Figure 3), and
#. that satisfaction did not differ by level of neighborhood diversity among Black and Latino residents (consistent with Figure 3), but lowered satisfaction among Asian residents with some uncertainty whether the difference was a statistical artifact (inconsistent with Figure 3).

#### Combining DCAS 2016 and DCAS 2018 data for analysis.\label{rob:combined}

In the second analysis, I combined the data from the DCAS 2016 and DCAS 2018 into a single dataset. The two datasets were combined into a single file and re-weighted to be representative of the DC area population based on the 2014-2018 American Community Survey. 

I used a similar model to that which led to the results reported in Figure \ref{fig:between}. To the model shown in Equation \ref{eqn:model}, I added a term that predicted the influence of being in each of the three samples: the DCAS 2016 multiracial neighborhood sample, the DCAS 2016 predominantly Latino sample, and the DCAS 2018 sample representative of the entire DC area. I also included interactions between respondent race and this sample variable. Table \ref{tab:combined} reports the parameter estimates of the model. 

\input{../analysis/tables/supp-combined.tex}

The parameter estimates confirm a difference between white residents in the DC area generally and those who live in multiracial neighborhoods. The odds of a white resident being satisfied in a multiracial neighborhood are only 34 percent as high as the odds that white residents living in the DC area generally are satisfied ($p<0.001$). Despite white residents having lower odds of being satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods than neighborhoods generally, white residents of multiracial neighborhoods are still more likely to be satisfied in their neighborhoods than not to be satisfied. At the mean 2018 values of other covariates, the combined analysis predicts that 71 percent of white residents of multiracial neighborhoods will be satisfied (compared to 88 percent of whites in the DC area overall).

Consistent with the findings reported in the analyses in the paper, Black and Latinx residents of multiracial neighborhoods were similarly satisfied in multiracial neighborhoods compared to their counterparts elsewhere. Seventy-six percent of Black residents were satisfied in their neighborhoods in both multiracial neighborhoods and in the DC area generally. Among Latinx residents, 73 percent of those living in multiracial neighborhoods were satisfied compared to 75 percent of DC-area Latinx adults generally.[^predom-latinx] The difference between Black and white residents of multiracial neighborhoods was statistically distinguishable from a null effect ($p<0.05$). The difference between Latinx and white residents in multiracial neighborhoods could not be distinguished from the null, but that appears largely due to the sample size because the effect size of the interaction, $\beta=0.952$, is quite large. Asian residents, in contrast, appear to follow a pattern very similar to white residents. 

[^predom-latinx]: Incidentally, the level of satisfaction among Latinx residents of multiracial neighborhoods was similar to that of Latinx residents of predominantly Latino neighborhoods. 

In summary, the results of the model combining the DCAS 2016 and DCAS 2018 samples are consistent with the results presented in Figure \ref{fig:between} of the paper. White residents of multiracial neighborhoods are less satisfied than white residents generally, a pattern shared only with Asian residents. Black and Latino residents of multiracial neighborhoods were similarly satisfied as Black and Latino residents of the DC area generally. 


#### Differences in white population change between multiracial and other neighborhoods{#rob:lntotchg-all}

A third analysis assessed the influence of changing white population on satisfaction among residents of the DC area. Using the same measure that I used above (the logged ratio of the white populations in 2015 to those in 2000), I examined the distribution of changes respondents in the DCAS 2016 experienced compared to those that the DCAS 2018 experienced. Figure @fig:supp-lntotchg-plt plots these two distributions.

One can see from Figure @fig:supp-lntotchg-plt that respondents to the DCAS 2018 live in neighborhoods that experienced a much larger distribution of change than the respondents to the DCAS 2016. Ignoring the one outlying neighborhood where the logged change ratio equaled almost seven, the standard deviation of logged white change among DCAS 2018 respondents was 0.82 while the standard deviation among DCAS 2016 residents was 0.35.[^king-farm]

[^king-farm]: The census tract with the dramatic change was where a new subdivision was built where previously a single family lived on a family-owned farm. 

![Distribution of logged ratio of white population, 2015 to 2000](../analysis/images/supp-lntotchg.pdf){#fig:supp-lntotchg-plt}

I examined whether the white population change from 2000 to 2015 affected the results reported in Figure 3. I centered the variable in all models around the mean change experienced by DCAS 2016 respondents and scaled the variable by the standard deviation of the DCAS 2016 respondents. I estimated two models for each set of data, one each with and without interactions with race. The interactions would account for the different sensitivity white residents have to the loss of white neighbors. The parameter estimates and standard errors are reported in Table \ref{tab:lnchgtot}.

\input{../analysis/tables/supp-lnchgtot.tex}

The first two columns of Table \ref{tab:lnchgtot} report parameter estimates using data representing residents of multiracial neighborhoods. The results in the first column show that residents were more satisfied in neighborhoods that gained more whites---or, inversely, lost fewer whites. Consistent with the parameter estimates reported in Table \ref{tab:within} of the manuscript, the table shows that 69 percent of residents were predicted to be satisfied living in a multiracial neighborhood with the mean white change ($exp{0.814}/[1 + exp{0.814}]$). Among residents of multiracial neighborhoods that experienced white losses one standard deviation below the mean, a majority---61 percent---were predicted to be satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods. Just as importantly, Model 2 shows that while satisfaction was lower in neighborhoods where more whites left, it was *equally low across all racial groups* (confirming, as well, the conclusions of Table \ref{tab:chgtert} with a different modeling strategy). 

The second two columns of Table \ref{tab:lnchgtot} report parameter estimates using data representing all DC-area residents. The amount of what change that occurred in the neighborhood had little influence on satisfaction of residents, though in the case of residents from the entire DC-area the data fit the model with an interaction better. The fourth column shows that the influence of white population growth was higher for Asian and Latinx residents was higher than the influence on whites, though only the the association for Latinx residents could be distinguished from the null. 

#### Summary of comparative satisfaction robustness analysis {#rob:comparative-summary}

The analyses of entropy among only DCAS 2018 respondents showed that satisfaction among White residents correlates with the racial diversity of neighborhoods. Satisfaction among other racial groups appeared be insensitive or less sensitive than whites to the racial diversity of neighborhood residents. These results comport with the findings reported in Figure 3 that compared the results of the two surveys. 

The influence of white population change were different in multiracial neighborhoods than DC-area neighborhoods general. Residents of multiracial neighborhoods, regardless of race, were more likely to be satisfied in neighborhoods where white populations had increased. This finding supports the notion of shared satisfaction across racial groups living in multiracial neighborhoods. 

Among neighborhoods in the DC area generally, Asian and Latinx were more likely satisfied than white and Black residents. The satisfaction of White and Black residents seemed unassociated with white population change. The differences between groups among neighborhoods in general do not contradict any of the conclusions of this paper, but do shed light on an area for further research.

# Reviewer Memo

I appreciate the reviewers' thoughtful and insightful comments on this manuscript. The comments helped me clarify elements that were not sufficiently clear in the first draft of this manuscript and have pushed me to improve how my paper engages with the existing literature on the topic. 

Two large issues seem to connect many of the individual comments: the problem of selection effects of who enters (and stays) in multiracial neighborhoods and the ability to compare across the sample of multiracial neighborhood residents and region-wide residents. I have tried, in the words of Reviewer 2, to "do anything else\ldots to convince readers that the results are 'real'\ldots" I briefly address these two general concerns here, and then I provide responses to individual comments that the reviewers provided below.

I have worked to assuage concerns about selection effects into multiracial neighborhoods in the revised manuscript and supplemental robustness analysis. I considered two forms of selection: who chooses *to move into* multiracial neighborhoods and who chooses *to stay* in multiracial neighborhoods (conditional on living in multiracial neighborhoods). The first supplemental analysis shows that white incoming white residents (who chose multiracial neighborhoods) did not differ from longer-term residents (who moved in when different racial compositions existed). I describe in the supplement why this empirical evidence combined with existing theory provides evidence against selection. In the second analysis, I found little evidence that interracial differences in satisfaction varied by the share of whites who left the neighborhood over the previous 15 years. While I cannot overcome the fact that the study design prevents me from fully eliminating selection effects, I believe that triangulating the original and supplemental analyses provide evidence that the analyses are robust to any obvious signs of selection effects. 

The supplement also addresses concerns about the comparative dimension of the analysis. The problem here arises from comparing results from two different samples. In one supplemental analysis, I used only the DCAS 2018 data that represented the entire DC area to estimate the association between neighborhood racial diversity and satisfaction. Measuring racial diversity using entropy, I found similar results using only the DCAS 2018 data to those reported in the original manuscript. 

In the same vein, Reviewer 3 correctly suggested that the best analysis would come from combining the 2016 and 2018 data together and then testing for an interaction effect between neighborhood type and race. Because the two surveys were weighted to different populations, this was not possible with the data available for the original paper. Based on the reviewer's suggestion, I contracted the survey research firm to combine and re-weight the data such that the combined data represented the entire DC area. Analyzing models using these data also ended with similar results to those reported in the original manuscript.

I opted to provide a supplement containing detailed descriptions of the robustness analyses with brief descriptions of the analyses in the text of the manuscript. Introducing all of the additional variables and analyses would substantially add to the length of the paper while, in my opinion, making it harder to read. At the same time, I felt it important to provide a complete and detailed description of the analyses for readers who are interested or who want to test the conclusions in the future. Providing brief descriptions of the robustness analyses in the manuscript and then including detailed descriptions in the supplement seemed like the best way to proceed. 

Below, I respond in detail to the specific concerns raised by each reviewer. 

## Responses to Reviewer 1 Comments

#### Multiracial neighborhood inclusion criteria.

The reviewer points out the proliferation of definitions in the literature and asked for clarity on the definition used in the DCAS. I used a combination of factors to arrive at the two criteria (10% to measure the presence of a racial group and no majority group). The data were collected to be used for both academic research and to inform policymakers. Having a clear definition that was easy to communicate while remaining consistent with the existing literature (even if not exactly the same as existing definitions). A 10% threshold was easy to communicate and was small enough that all racial groups could surpass the threshold without disproportionate clustering given the racial diversity of the region (which could, paradoxically, exacerbate segregation). 

I based the requirement that no majority was present on research by Krysan and her colleagues that racial composition exerts a large influence on perceptions of places. Having no majority increased the probability that the neighborhoods would be perceived as multiracial (though perceptions lag) rather than being dominated by one racial group. 

#### Stability of multiracial neighborhoods. 

I appreciate that the original manuscript overstated evidence in favor of multiracial stability. In addition to citing Ellen & colleague's paper, I also rewrote the final part of the "Shared Satisfaction with Multiracial Integration" section. I now devote the final paragraph to evidence contradicting the stability of multiracial integration and that the instability of multiracial integration calls into question the sense of shared satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods (page \pageref{rev:shared-satisfaction} of the revised manuscript). In addition, I removed "and stability" from the first sentence of the third paragraph (that had previously read "The recent growth and stability of multiracial neighborhoods \ldots").

#### Multiracial neighborhoods in transition.

The existing evidence showing that multiracial neighborhoods commonly undergo transitions could undermine evidence of shared satisfaction. I empirically examined white loss since that is the dominant form of transition for multiracial neighborhoods (cf., Kye and Halpern-Manners (2019). Figure S3 shows the distribution of white population loss in the sampled multiracial neighborhoods. The neighborhoods lost, on average, 20 percent of the white population from 2000 to 2015. That 20 percent, however, should be put in the context that, in the US, 31 percent of non-Hispanic whites moved from 2010 to 2015.[^15-year] The loss of whites causing transitions appear, therefore, to be the result of whites *not entering* multiracial neighborhoods, an observation consistent with the socially structured search process of Krysan and Crowder (2016). This observation is further supported by Figure S1 that shows that whites made up only 29 percent of residents who moved into these neighborhoods in the past ten years, a rate lower than replacement in multiracial neighborhoods. It is also worth noting that residents living in a fifth of the neighborhoods included in the sample *gained* white population from 2000 to 2015. 

[^15-year]: At a constant mobility rate of 31 percent, we would have expected only a third of the white residents present in 2000 to have remained in multiracial neighborhoods (i.e, $[1-0.31]^3=0.33$). 

The range of the distribution indicates that the neighborhoods have experienced a variety of changes. The range speaks to a benefit of data that represent residents of multiracial neighborhoods, what I believe to be one of the strengths of this manuscript and analysis. 

In addition to the range of transitions, the reviewer raises a different important point: white losses transitions could signal higher dissatisfaction among whites than other groups. Pages S4-S8 of the Supplement address this concern by examining whether white satisfaction differs as a function of white population loss. The results in Table S3 show little evidence that white residents are less satisfied than their neighbors of color in neighborhoods that lost a larger share of white residents. In the bottom two tertiles of white loss, the data fit the model that included race worse than the model without race. Both the overall context of transition coming from moves into neighborhoods and the lack of racial differences in satisfaction by the rate of white loss increase my confidence that a sense of shared satisfaction exists in multiracial neighborhoods. 

I include a summary of this robustness analysis on page \pageref{rev:internal} of the revised manuscript with a reference to the supplement for those who wish to examine the evidence further.

#### Issues with map in Figure 1.

I am embarrassed that the basic elements the reviewer suggested were not in the original manuscript (and I'm sure my GIS instructors would be ashamed!). I have added the components that the reviewer mentioned. I have also removed reference to "quadrivial" as the reviewer mentioned; this was a remnant from a previous version of the manuscript. I struggled with terminology throughout drafting the paper for precisely the reasons that the reviewer wrote. I decided against using the term quadrivial because, as the reviewer notes, it implies stability that was not a criterion for inclusion. I neglected to revise the term in the map after revising it in the paper. 

#### Walton's (2018/2021) "habits of whiteness".

Walton's (2021) "habits of whiteness" likely affects the perceptions that residents develop about their multiracial neighborhoods and, as a result, their satisfaction. As such, they would be part of the amalgam of experiences that affect satisfaction among residents. It would be valuable, for example, to test whether shared satisfaction depends on the norms of behaviors within multiracial neighborhoods. That analysis, however, differs from the research questions in this manuscript. That said, Walton's contribution lies in the *relationships* between residents and how norms default to those that make white residents comfortable. This interpretative lens is one that should be explored further. I appreciate the reviewer helping me to draw this connection, and I now include the habits of whiteness as a potential issue associated with racial integration on page \pageref{rev:habits} of the revised manuscript.

#### Citing Pinto-Coelho & Zuberi (2015).

I now reference their paper in the discussion of the DC-area context on page \pageref{rev:pinto-coelho}.

#### Commonness of multiracial neighborhoods. 

The reviewer raises an important point about the (lack of) commonness of multiracial neighborhoods even as their numbers have grown. I have edited the sentence to now read "Multiracial neighborhoods---those neighborhoods shared among Asian, Black, Latino, and white neighbors---are no longer anomalies in many metropolitan areas" that I believe addresses the concern. 

#### Figure 2 is unnecessary.

I have kept Figure 2 because I think that it helps readers interpret the findings and it also demonstrates the similarity in preferences after accounting for the different distributions of independent variables across racial groups within multiracial neighborhoods. The average marginal effects take into account the fact that, because the models are not linear, the predicted probabilities depend on the distribution of the independent variables [@long_regression_2005].

#### Rename discussion.

I have renamed the final section "Discussion and Conclusions" -- thank you for this helpful advice.

#### Uniqueness of DC area multiracial neighborhoods.

The reviewer raises an important point about addressing how the Washington, DC area fits in relation to other metropolitan areas in both describing the context of the study and the conclusions. I have followed the reviewer's advice and now explain how many highly diverse neighborhoods exist in the Washington, DC area, and also I describe how the number of highly diverse neighborhoods have grown in the DC area while shrinking in number in other metropolitan areas on \pageref{rev:dc-data} of the revised manuscript.

I also added several sentences to the conclusions on page \pageref{rev:dc-conclusions} arguing for more comparative analysis between metro areas. I found it difficult to say much more with so little data on the experiences of residents living in multiracial neighborhoods. I do note that the experience might be similar to other "new immigration destination" metropolitan areas that have seen a growth in knowledge work and increases in the number of multiracial neighborhoods, drawing on the types of metros where Wright, et al. (2020, *Sociol Race Ethn*) growing numbers of highly diverse neighborhoods. 

#### Cite Matsumoto(2020).

I appreciate the reviewer informing me of this piece. I now cite it in the discussion of qualitative studies about multiracial neighborhoods on page \pageref{rev:matsumoto} of the revised manuscript.

## Responses to Reviewer 2 Comments

#### Survey details.

I have provided more information, including response rates, for the surveys on page \pageref{rev:survey} of the revised manuscript.

#### Figure 1 (map). 

I appreciate the reviewer's comments about the map. I have chosen to keep the map in the manuscript for two reasons. First, I believe that it depicts the location and geographic dispersion of multiracial neighborhoods. In revising the text, I found that text-based descriptions did not provide this context as well, especially among readers unfamiliar with the DC area. Second, the map provides a basis to compare the locations described in Pinto-Coelho & Zuberi's (2015) analysis that Reviewer 1 sagely suggested referencing. 

The reviewer identified several problems with the map that likely made it less useful. As I describe in the response to Reviewer 1 above, the term "quadrivial" mistakenly remained from previous versions of the manuscript. The named communities referred to places also used in a previous version of the manuscript and ended up distracting readers. I also added text (starting on page \pageref{rev:map} of the revised manuscript) to provide the reader with more detail about what the map shows relative to the research questions posed in this paper. 

I believe with these changes and amendments, the map now provides an appropriate and useful context for readers to understand the area being studied. 

#### Differences in context for the two surveys.

The reviewer notes three differences between the two surveys, with the latter two potentially contaminating the comparison:

#. multi-racial neighborhood residents versus non-multiracial residents;
#. the passage of two years; and
#. likely differences in survey instruments

No major events disrupted the housing market or would likely have had an influence on reports of neighborhood satisfaction between 2016 and 2018. Furthermore, all of the dependent variables for the analysis were measured using questions on the first page of the respective questionnaires that were very similar to one another (I now note this in the manuscript in the description of the surveys on \pageref{rev:survey}), limiting potential priming effects that would have caused measurement artifacts to cause different responses. In addition, I conducted the sensitivity analysis using only the DCAS 2018 data that the reviewer recommended (I describe the results and revisions in the following comment).

#### Compare multiracial neighborhoods to other neighborhoods using DCAS 2018 data.

I followed the reviewer's suggestion and I analyzed the 2018 data using a model that included entropy as a measure of diversity. The comparison helped to ensure that the estimates from the two surveys were plausible despite differences between the surveys. The results are described in the supplement, starting on page \pageref{rob:entropy}. I used entropy because the sample size of different neighborhood racial compositions (e.g., measured based on racial groups present) was too small to allow meaningful comparisons. At the mean entropy level of multiracial neighborhoods, 76 percent of white residents were satisfied, while 84 percent of white residents were satisfied at the average level of entropy among white residents in the DC area. Though the difference is not statistically significant, the magnitudes and direction are consistent with the results reported in Figure \ref{fig:between} of the manuscript. Meanwhile entropy did not predict different levels of satisfaction among Black and Latinx residents. Asian residents were *more* likely than whites to be satisfied with lower levels of entropy (though not significantly so). 

## Responses to Reviewer 3 Comments

#### Heterogeneity in white population change.

The supplement now describes white population change among multiracial neighborhoods (pp. \pageref{rob:internal}--\pageref{rob:comparative}). As I wrote in response to Reviewer 1, neighborhood change appears to be the result of disproportionately low rates of white residents moving in than current white residents moving out. The share of white residents leaving multiracial neighborhoods did not influence interracial differences in neighborhood satisfaction.

#### Comparison of white population change in multiracial neighborhoods to other neighborhoods.

To address the reviewer's comment about neighborhood stability, I have added analyses in the supplement to assess the association between neighborhood change and neighborhood satisfaction (pp. \pageref{rob:comparative}--\pageref{rob:comparative-summary}). Table \ref{tab:lnchgtot} shows that white gains in population increased the share of satisfied residents of multiracial neighborhoods, but did so across all racial groups (the model with race-by-change interactions fit the data worse than the model without, a finding consistent with the internal satisfaction supplemental analysis in Table \ref{tab:nhwyrs}). In the region-wide sample, the data fit the model including interactions better than the model without, but none of the individual coefficients was significantly different than zero. White residents were more satisfied in neighborhoods that lost smaller shares of the white population; losing whites affected the satisfaction of Asian and Latino residents (the Latino-by-change interaction coefficient was close to statistical significance, $p=0.062$) more than whites, but that was after those two groups started from lower probabilities of satisfaction initially. 

I also take to heart the reviewer's larger point about comparison across neighborhoods and, as a result, have been more explicit about the limitations that these data pose for a full comparative analysis. Given the consistency of findings from the comparison reported in Figure \ref{fig:between} and the estimates of the model that included entropy in Table \ref{tab:entropy} (suggested by Reviewer 2), I feel confident stating that a difference in white satisfaction exists. I do not, however, feel confident that the differences aren't explained by various neighborhood changes occurring simultaneously. Unfortunately, the data I have are not suited to analyze these simultaneous changes because the region-wide data lack clustering in neighborhoods that would allow me to disentangle individual from neighborhood associations. As a result, I have tried to be more circumspect in the discussion and to identify this as an area in need of more research, including specific suggestions on the type of data and analysis needed (revision on page \pageref{rev:comparative-conclusions} of the manuscript).

#### Estimates from analysis pooling both surveys. 

As I wrote in my general summary of changes above, the reviewer correctly notes that a pooled analysis provides the best way to test statistical differences between DC-area residents and multiracial residents. Given that the weights of the two datasets led both to represent different populations, I could not simply combine the two datasets. After purchasing the combined weights from the survey research company, I was able to show that the results were actually stronger in the pooled analysis than what appears in Figure \ref{fig:between}.

I have included an explanation of the results of the pooled samples in the supplement (beginning on page \pageref{rob:combined}). The point estimates of neighborhood satisfaction estimated from the pooled sample are similar to those reported in the separate analyses. The standard errors of the difference between white residents of multiracial neighborhoods and white residents in the DC area are *smaller* in the pooled sample than in the separate samples. I chose to retain the results of the unpooled samples in the manuscript since the point estimates are similar in the pooled an unpooled samples, the unpooled sample provided a more conservative estimate of the statistical significance of the difference, and because the pooled sample introduces another source of data (a pooled, reweighted sample) and include predominantly Latino neighborhoods (that are not currently described in the manuscript). I refer interested readers to the pooled samples to the supplement where I report the estimates and describe the results using the pooled sample.
