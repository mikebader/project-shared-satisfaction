Multiracial neighborhoods---those shared among Asian, black, Latinx, and white neighbors---have become common in U.S. metropolitan areas since the 1980s. @logan_global_2011 estimated that 38 percent of neighborhoods in 2010 were what they termed "global neighborhoods." Similarly, @bader_fragmented_2016 found stable multiracial integration, what they called "quadrivial neighborhoods," represented between eight and twenty percent of neighborhoods in the metropolitan areas of the four largest cities. That multiracial neighborhoods emerged from barely existing three decades ago to being an appreciable number of metropolitan neighborhoods reflects changes to the relationship between between race and metropolitan space. The presence of multiracially integrated neighborhoods seemingly indicate progress toward equity. 

Empirically, however, racial integration has reduced levels of neighborhood satisfaction. The reason for lower satisfaction has been the subject of debate. Social disorganization theories posit that racial differences reduce social capital and trust that lead to lower satisfaction. These theories predict low levels of satisfaction among all racial groups living in multiracial neighborhoods. Racial stratification theories predict that white residents with resources will flee integrating neighborhoods, leaving the most disgruntled white residents in integrated neighborhoods. For many people of color, however, integrated neighborhoods represent an improvement over disadvantaged neighborhoods into which they have been steered by historical and ongoing segregation. Finally, neighborhood lifecourse theories argue that neighborhood change leads to dissatisfaction, and heterogeneity acts as a proxy of this underlying change. 

The three theories predict racial differences in satisfaction within multiracial neighborhoods, yet empirical tests of the theories have focused only on differences between neighborhoods. As a result, studies have not measured how much neighborhood satisfaction among current residents of multiracial neighborhoods depends varies by race. This paper remedies this oversight by assessing the level of satisfaction among a representative sample of residents living in multiracial neighborhoods in the Washington, DC area, and by comparing the responses to a representative sample of the all residents Washington, DC area. 

I make the argument in this paper that multiracial neighborhoods level-out racial disparities in neighborhood satisfaction. White residents of multiracial neighborhoods tend to be less satisfied than whites generally; inversely, Asian **[CHECK]**, black, and Latino residents of multiracial neighborhoods are more satisfied than their counterparts generally. In contrast to the expectation of social disorganization theory, however, satisfaction is relatively high and approximately equal to neighborhood satisfaction in the metropolitan area as a whole. Put simply, multiracial neighborhoods equalize racial disparities evident elsewhere in the metropolitan area. 

This leveling hypothesis is consistent with recent qualitative research on multiracial neighborhoods. These studies find a general satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods that comes about because residents of different racial groups compromise on desired neighborhood qualities rather than attempt to optimize race-specific preferences. **[GENERAL STATEMENT OF IMPORTANCE HERE]**

# Neighborhood Satisfaction in Racially Integrated Neighborhoods

## Theoretical Approaches

Research in the United States consistently finds evidence of lower satisfaction among residents living in integrated neighborhoods. Researchers have devised several theories to explain why racial integration diminishes neighborhood satisfaction. Each theory implies a set of mechanisms that create differences between neighborhoods as well as differences across residents within neighborhoods. 

*Social disorganization theory* posits that multiracial integration itself undermines neighborhood social capital and attachment. Race forms such a strong basis for social solidarity that the mere presence of racial others undermines trust and attachment to neighbors. Putnam further argued that diversity diminishes social capital among *all* residents, and its influence would not limited to interracial relationships. Social disorganization theory implies that neighborhood satisfaction will be low across all racial groups within multiracial neighborhoods. 

A group of other models focus on *racial stratification* to explain lower satisfaction. These models are grounded in Park and Burgess' invasion/succession model of human ecology. The defended neighborhoods hypothesis argues that existing residents establish and maintain neighborhood boundaries to exert control. Incursion by people of color into all-white neighborhoods leads to violent responses or appeals to the municipal authorities to resolve disputes. If those efforts fail to stymie the influx of racial outsiders, those with the means to do so leave the neighborhood. This view of neighborhoods as communities of "limited liability" implies that the most disgruntled whites and those least satisfied with neighborhood changes, would remain in the neighborhood. This process also implies the stratification of neighborhoods as whites with resources leave, leading to lower housing demand, as people of color enter the neighborhood. 

In contrast to the social disorganization theory, racial stratification theories imply that incumbent residents will be less satisfied than incoming residents. Whites, who are nearly always the incumbents in multiracial neighborhoods, would be less satisfied than their neighbors of color since multiracial neighborhoods almost exclusively emerged from neighborhoods that were overwhelming white. The theories would expect that the whites left behind after the unsuccessful "defense" of racial boundaries would be especially dissatisfied in the neighborhood. Inversely, people of color are especially attracted to integrated neighborhoods while whites are not. Residents of color might become even more satisfied with neighborhoods as diversity increases while white residents become less satisfied.  

A final set of models focus on *neighborhood life course* to explain dissatisfaction. The systemic model proposed by Kasarda and Janowitz argues that residential turnover undermines neighborhood social capital. Multiracial neighborhoods might be the result of those neighborhoods having experienced recent residential turnover, not due to racial differences *per se*. Qualitative evidence suggests that residents are satisfied living in neighborhoods with a long history of integration and identity as diverse neighborhoods. Residents have built strong relationships in these neighborhoods, even if they are not always interracial relationships, that increase their neighborhood attachment. Life course theory would predict *higher* satisfaction among whites given their longer tenure in multiracial neighborhoods (which also implies that controlling for time in residence would negate racial differences). The theory would not predict racial differences in assessments of neighborhood change, but would predict a strong positive relationship between length of residence and assessments of change. 

## Empirical Findings of Neighborhood Satisfaction in Multiracial Neighborhoods

The theories above imply both differences in satisfaction between neighborhoods and differences in satisfaction within neighborhoods. To date, however, research on multiracial neighborhoods has focused almost exclusively on the former. That research has generally found lower levels of satisfaction in racially integrated neighborhoods than neighborhoods with other types of racial composition.

Social disorganization theory has received substantial support as the source of lower satisfaction in integrated neighborhoods. Hipp, in the most comprehensive study to date on the topic of residential satisfaction, found strong evidence in favor of social disorganization theory. He found that racial heterogeneity had a strong negative effect on satisfaction that was independent of the additional strong negative effect that perceptions of crime. Woldoff similarly found that social disorganization lowered neighborhood attachment. She found that black residents were more attached to their neighborhoods even though they evaluated them lower than comparable white residents. Legewie and Schaeffer found integrated neighborhoods tended to have higher incidences of complaints for minor incivilities. These studies indicate a general sense of declining neighborhood satisfaction among residents of integrated neighborhoods. These findings lead to the hypotheses that:

Social disorganization hypothesis 1:

: white, black, Latino, and Asian residents of multiracial neighborhoods will be less satisfied than their counterparts of the same race living elsewhere

Social disorganization hypothesis 2:

: white, black, Latino, and Asian residents of will all have similarly low levels of satisfaction 

Racial stratification theory has also received support. Swaroop and Krysan found evidence that neighborhood satisfaction was lower among whites who lived in neighborhoods with fewer whites. In contrast, however, satisfaction was much *higher* among Latinos who lived in neighborhoods with fewer Latinos, and that race had little influence on black residents. Greif found that whites generally had the highest neighborhood satisfaction, and that black and Latino homeowners were especially sensitive to problematic social conditions. Studies of moves out of neighborhoods, an indirect measure of neighborhood dissatisfaction, find that whites are more likely to leave neighborhoods as the percentage of non-whites increases. These studies point to a declining satisfaction among whites experiencing integration, and a sensitivity of black and Latino residents to the negative neighborhood consequences associated with segregation. These studies provide a sense of how residents of the same race perceive neighborhoods with differing levels of integration, but do not measure differences by satisfaction among residents of different races who make up multiracial neighborhoods. 

Racial stratification hypothesis 1a:

: white residents of multiracial neighborhoods will be less satisfied than their white counterparts living elsewhere

Racial stratification hypothesis 1b: 

: black, Latino, and Asian residents of multiracial neighborhoods will be more satisfied than counterparts of the same race living elsewhere

Racial stratification Hypothesis 2:

: white residents of multiracial neighborhoods will be less satisfied than their black, Latino, and Asian neighbors

Minimal evidence supports the systemic factors of the neighborhood life course perspective. Some evidence exists that the racial composition of a neighborhood acts as a proxy or cognitive shortcut since racial composition correlates with neighborhood problems. Notably, Kasarda and Janowitz who developed the theory of these systemic factors, did so based on data from Great Britain. Although they claim that the findings would "converge with those already encountered in the United States," they do not explain how accounting for race would vary their findings. 

Neighborhood life course hypothesis:

: there will be no racial differences within or between neighborhoods after controlling for length of residence, housing tenure, and other aspects of neighborhoods

## Leveling 

Qualitative studies have examined the internal dynamics of multiracial neighborhoods. Lumley-Sapanksi and Fowler find a general satisfaction in a "hyperdiverse" neighborhood in Seattle. Residents have little internal consensus over what they want so that every group seems to get some, but not all, of what they want. Similarly, Spitz finds that neighborhood residents value diversity in a multiracial neighborhood, but racial groups tend to participate in racially homogenous activities. Maly has argued that a collective identity developed around racial diversity can help different groups feel satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods. Given the interpretive nature of these studies, however, they were not designed to represent statistically the population of residents. 

These qualitative studies suggest that multiracial neighborhoods help "level" satisfaction among groups. Whites are generally more satisfied with their neighborhoods than blacks and Latinos, in large part because historical segregation created more desirable conditions in predominantly white neighborhoods. Some amenities that make white neighborhoods the most desirable might be missing from multiracial neighborhoods. But those amenities are less frequently found in predominantly black or predominantly Latino neighborhoods. Leveling suggests that the racial stratification hypotheses 1a and 1b would hold, but that all racial groups would have similar---but high---levels of satisfaction. That is, in multiracial neighborhoods:

Leveling hypothesis:

: white, black, Latino, and Asian residents of multiracial neighborhoods will all have similarly high levels of satisfaction 


# Data & Methods

## Study Region
Data to test the hypotheses come from two samples of Washington, DC-area residents in 2016 and 2018. Washington, D.C. has historically been a segregated metropolitan area. Almost all blacks lived in the eastern part of the city and nearly all whites in the western part. This east-west pattern spilled out to the Maryland suburbs. A few blacks lived across the Potomac River in Northern Virginia, though they were highly clustered in a small number of neighborhoods. In 1980, Asians and Latinxs each made up only 3 percent of the DC-area population.

The region's economy grew and became less based on the federal government in the 1980s and 1990s. The expansion of finance, insurance, and real estate services sector mirrored the sector's prominence in redeveloping metropolitan areas in the U.S. and abroad. During the same period, the region emerged as an immigrant destination: by 2015 a quarter of residents were born outside of the United States, with the largest shares of foreign-born residents having come from El Salvador, India, and Korea. Latinos and Asians now comprise 16 and 11 percent of DC-area residents, respectively, while blacks make up 29 percent and whites 41 percent of the population. As the nation's capital and importance in international relations, the region's foreign-born residents are more socioeconomically diverse than average. Among foreign-born residents ages 25 and older in the DC area, 21 percent have a bachelor's degree and 22 percent have a graduate degree, compared to 17 percent and 12 percent nationally. 

Real estate developers capitalized on the expanding population by developing large swaths of land in middle-ring suburbs encircling the District. Having been built after the Fair Housing Act passed, the housing developed was not subject to the history of redlining and restrictive covenants. Residents of all races were attracted to these new suburban homes, especially in Montgomery and Fairfax Counties that boasted nationally renowned school systems. Additionally, Montgomery County has, since 1974, mandated that all housing developments larger than 20 units include a set percentage of units that qualify as affordable housing [@urban_institute_expanding_2012].[^fairfax] As Figure @fig:map shows, multiracial neighborhoods were especially likely to emerge along the hub-and-spoke system of the region's commuter rail lines in these counties [see also, @holloway_racially_2012].

![Map of sampled tracts in 2016 DC Area Survey](../analysis/images/DCASCommunityMap.png){#fig:map}

[^fairfax]: Fairfax County passed an inclusionary zoning ordinance in 1971, but it was struck down by the Virginia Supreme Court. Fairfax County implemented a different mandatory inclusionary zoning policy in 1990 [@silverstein_welcome_2017].

## Survey Samples

Both surveys represented residents in the Washington, DC area, which comprised Washington, D.C. and the surrounding jurisdictions of Montgomery and Prince George's Counties in Maryland, Arlington and Fairfax (including the cities of Falls Church and Fairfax) Counties Virginia, and the independent city of Alexandria, Virginia. The 2016 DC Area Survey sought to represent residents of two types of neighborhoods---multiracial and disproportionately Latinx---in the Washington, D.C. area, and analyses only include responses from residents sampled in the multiracial neighborhoods. The 2018 DC Area Survey drew a representative sample of the entire DC area, stratified by jurisdiction.[^combined]

[^combined]: Arlington County and the City of Alexandria were combined into a single stratum. 

Multiracial neighborhoods included in the 2016 DCAS sampling frame met two criteria. First, neighborhoods comprised at least 10 percent Asian, black, Latinx, and white residents. This cutoff was used to ensure that each of the four racial groups represented a distinguishable subset of a neighborhood's residents. Second, none of those four groups could represent a majority of residents. This criterion was included to eliminate neighborhoods where a single group formed the dominant identity of the neighborhood.[^latino-enclaves] These criteria resulted in a sample frame of 114 neighborhoods that represented just under 585,000 people.[^one-criterion] The majority of neighborhoods were in Montgomery County, Maryland, followed by Fairfax County, Virginia, then Prince George's County, Maryland. The neighborhoods included in the sampling frame are shown in Figure @fig:map. An address-based sample of households was drawn from these eligible neighborhoods and included over-samples of households with Asian and Hispanic surnames and households located in from disproportionately black tracts among those that still satisfied the criteria to be included as multiracial neighborhoods. The 2018 DCAS included over-samples of tracts with disproportionately large black and Latino populations. 

[^latino-enclaves]: Disproportionately Latinx neighborhoods were those in which Latinx residents made up at least a quarter of the residents and were not already classified as a multiracial neighborhood.

[^one-criterion]: Eighteen neighborhoods met the first inclusion criterion but not the second. Of those eighteen, fifteen were neighborhoods that had a white majority; six were located in Fairfax County, Virginia (including one in Fairfax city), five in Montgomery County, Maryland, and two each in D.C. and Arlington County, Virginia. Two neighborhoods had a black majority, one each in Montgomery County and Prince George's County, and only one neighborhood, in Montgomery County, had a Latinx majority. **MOVE TO APPENDIX?**

Table **1 *{tab:nhddescriptives}*** contains a comparison of multiracial neighborhoods to all neighborhoods in the DC area. Whites make up about a third of multiracial neighborhoods, on average, while Latinxs make up about a quarter. Blacks and Asians make up 22 and 18 percent of residents, respectively. Immigration represented the largest deviation of multiracial neighborhoods from DC-area neighborhoods overall. Immigrants make up two of every five residents in multiracial neighborhoods, compared to just under one of every four residents in neighborhoods overall. Residents of multiracial neighborhoods had slightly lower educational attainment than neighborhoods overall. One in four residents of multiracial neighborhoods, however, had a bachelor's degree and one in five had a post-graduate degree. Married households and those with children comprised a larger share of households in multiracial neighborhoods compared to DC area neighborhoods overall.

in multiethnic and quadrivial neighborhoods in the DC Area (#tab:nhooddesc)

## Dependent Variable

The analyses used a dichotomous measure of neighborhood satisfaction. Both surveys asked respondents, "How satisfied are you with your neighborhood as a place to live?," a question that has been used in previous research [see, e.g., @woldoff_effects_2002; @greif_intersection_2015]. To measure current neighborhood *satisfaction*, respondents who indicated that they were "extremely" or "very" satisfied living in their neighborhood were coded as being satisfied. Those who indicated that they were "somewhat" or "not at all" satisfied were coded as being unsatisfied.

## Independent Variable
A measure created from respondents' self-identified race and ethnicity was the independent variable in all analyses. I classified racial groups into four mutually exclusive categories based on the respondents' answers to questions about race (respondents were allowed to choose multiple racial groups) and Hispanic ethnicity. I classified those respondents who indicated Hispanic ethnicity as *Latinx*, regardless of their race. Among the remaining non-Latinx respondents, I classified as *white* those who selected white as their only race; as *black* those identified as black, either alone or in combination with any other race; and as *Asian* those who identified as Asian or Pacific Islander, either alone or in combination with any race other than black. Respondents missing on either the race question or the ethnicity question and respondents who did not satisfy the criteria above were not included in the analysis. This left a final analytic dataset of **{N(2016)}** respondents in 2016 and **{N(2018)}** respondents in 2018.

## Control Variables
I included variables to control for other demographic characteristics of residents. I calculated *age* based on respondents' birth year and *gender* based on respondents' gender identity, for which they were given the choices "male," "female," and "other." Female was set as the reference. Only two respondents chose "other" and were coded as missing on this question. I included an indicator for *being partnered* based on those respondents who indicated that they were "now married or in a marriage-style arrangement," with those not currently partnered as the reference.

I included whether the respondent had *children in the household* because the presence of children could affect the outlook residents have of their neighborhoods. The question did not limit the response to respondents' own children. I also included an indicator to measure whether respondents were *foreign born* since immigrant status would likely correlate with residential perceptions and race simultaneously.

I represented socioeconomic status with a measure of *educational attainment*. I created a measure with five categories based on the highest level of education respondents reported: less than high school, high school (including GED), some college (including associates degrees), bachelors degree, and graduate degree. I chose to use educational attainment to measure socioeconomic status because it is a more stable measure than income, and space did not permit the DCAS to ascertain income longitudinally. Income also had more missing data (N=) compared to educational attainment (N=**{miinc}**). Among those respondents who answered both questions, however, education and income were highly correlated.

I also include measures of neighborhood experience that account for neighborhood lifecourse characteristics. First, I included the *years respondents lived in their neighborhoods* since the lifecourse model presumes that people will become accustomed to the norms and will become more satisfied as they live in the neighborhood over a longer period. Second, I included a measure of *neighborhood size*. This measure was self-reported by respondents and including it in models accounts for how subjective perceptions of neighborhood boundaries affect satisfaction and perceived change. Table **{#tab:descriptives}** contains descriptive statistics of variables for the complete samples of the 2016 DCAS and the 2018 DCAS, as well as each survey by racial group.

## Analytical Approach

I used logistic regression analysis to test the hypotheses above. The general model is expressed in equation [\[eq:generalmodel\]](#eq:generalmodel){reference-type="ref" reference="eq:generalmodel"}:

$$\label{eq:generalmodel}
\mathbf{\eta} = \alpha + \mathbf{\beta^T X} + \mathbf{\gamma^T Z} + \mathbf{\delta_j}$$

where $\mathbf{\eta}$ is the vector of outcomes for respondents transformed using a logistic link function. In the model, $\alpha$ measures the intercept, and $\mathbf{\beta}$ is a vector of point estimates for racial groups (with whites omitted). Non-Latinx whites were the reference group since the hypotheses ask whether whites differ from other groups. The vector $\mathbf{\gamma}$ contains point estimates of demographic and neighborhood experience controls, $\mathbf{Z}$. I first estimated each outcome with only the intercept and race terms included. I then estimated each outcome with controls present. I conducted all analyses in R version **{Rversion}**.

All models included a fixed effect, $\mathbf{\delta_j}$, for the neighborhood of residence. Neighborhoods were defined as residents' census tracts. Including neighborhood fixed effects makes the estimates, $\mathbf{\beta}$, reflect the differences between white outcomes and those of Asians, blacks, and Latinxs *living in the same neighborhood*. Respondents who lived in neighborhoods without other respondents (N=**{oneresp}**) were removed from the analysis. The remaining respondents lived in tracts with a median of **{medNpertract}** and a maximum of **{maxNpertract}**.

All analyses accounted for missing data and the complex survey design. I used the `Amelia` package [@honaker_amelia_2011] to impute missing values in five datasets. I conducted all analyses using these five datasets weighting outcomes to account for the complex sample design using the `survey` library. I combined all results using Rubin's [-@rubin_multiple_2004] rules. All data and code used for the models presented here are available at \[redacted\].



# Notes

Legewie and Schaeffer provide a synthesis of these two perspectives in their *contested boundary hypothesis*. They argue that ambiguity of racial boundaries increases social disorganization. The theory has not been tested on multiracial integration specifically. The novelty of multiracial neighborhoods suggest ambiguous social norms consistent with the contested boundaries hypothesis that would lead to disorganization and lower attachment to the neighborhood among residents.



#. Studying satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods can improve our theories of race and place. Three theories:
    #. Systemic Theory
    #. Place stratification
    #. Contested boundaries hypothesis (constrict claim)

#. All three theories describe differences *between* neighborhoods, but all have implications for differences *within* neighborhoods. Multiracial neighborhoods offer good test. Also stability will depend on the extent to which all groups are satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods.
    #. Systemic theory would predict that whites have higher satisfaction than people of color since they have lived in the neighborhood the longest; people of color will come to like the neighborhood more as they assimilate
    #. Contested boundaries suggests that racial groups will have similar, but low levels of satisfaction given that social disorganization will likely be higher in multiracial neighborhoods
    #. Place stratification theory would predicts that whites will have lower level of satisfaction relative to people of color because they were unable to move

#. Miscellaneous

    #. Including fixed effects will increase standard errors around the point estimates. Accordingly, the association between race and satisfaction must be measured by its influence on model fit, not based exclusively on whether individual coefficients reach statistical significance. 


    #. We must judge the relevance of race on satisfaction based on whether it improves the model fit, not only by statistical significance of specific coefficients. 


#. Practical Relevance: The analysis carries practical implications beyond the theoretical intervention.
