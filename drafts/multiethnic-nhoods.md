title: Satisfaction in Multiracial Neighborhoods
author: Michael D.`\`{=latex} M.`\`{=latex} Bader
abstract: |
    Multiracial integration has become common among neighborhoods in many US metropolitan areas. This paper proposes that widespread satisfaction among residents of multiracial neighborhoods provides a basis for stable racial integration. This proposition counters existing change-based theories arguing that racial integration leads to dissatisfaction that destabilizes neighborhoods. I examined neighborhood satisfaction using data representing residents living in multiracial neighborhoods in the Washington, DC area. I found that Asian, Black, Latino, and white residents all had high and, more importantly, *equal* levels of satisfaction living in multiracial neighborhoods. Asian, Black, and Latino residents were more likely than white ones to perceive improvement in their neighborhoods, while most whites perceived that neighborhoods neither improved nor worsened. White residents were the only racial group among whom residents of multiracial neighborhoods were less satisfied than the metropolitan-wide average. The results suggest that multiracial neighborhoods act as a leveling structure that reduce metropolitan racial inequality.

Multiracial neighborhoods shared among Asian, Black, Latino, and white neighbors have emerged in appreciable numbers since the 1980s. Evidence suggests that multiracial neighborhoods might be becoming even more common in major metropolitan areas. Multiracial neighborhoods were made possible due to changes in immigration policy and fair housing legislation, as well as a growing tolerance among whites in the United States.[^intro]

[^intro]: INTRO NEEDS CITATIONS! 

Nearly all theories of urban change would not have predicted the emergence and increasing numbers of multiracial neighborhoods. Theories of urban change tend to build on the human ecological model of inter-group competition for resources. Existing theories consider differences in racial identity to represent such a chasm that racial integration undermines neighborhood cohesion and leads residents to become dissatisfied. The few integrated neighborhoods that existed were held up as notable exceptions to the general rule of dissatisfaction and change. 

The growth and stability of multiracial neighborhoods contradict traditional theories of racial change. Inductive research demonstrates that residents find satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods. Racial diversity becomes a collective identity that residents work to protect. The contradiction between these studies and traditional theories of neighborhood change calls into question the general rule that integration begets dissatisfaction with neighborhoods. If true, multiracial integration offers opportunities to consider alternatives to perpetual racial segregation that divide people and resources in US metropolitan areas. Yet, its difficult to examine whether these neighborhoods still represent new exceptions or part of a larger trend of interracial satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods. 

This article provides evidence for a shared sense of satisfaction among residents of multiracial neighborhoods. The conclusion is based on data from two surveys in the Washington, DC area, one representing residents of multiracial neighborhoods and the other representing residents in the entire DC area. Using data from these two surveys, I conclude that multiracial neighborhoods engender interracial neighborhood satisfaction and could be a structure that levels opportunities in US metropolitan areas. 

# Race as a Disintegrating Social Force

The most dominant theories of neighborhood change predict lower satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods than in other types of neighborhoods. These theories rest on the foundational notion that racial organizes society to such a strong degree that racial differences undermine social cohesion \needcite . The origins of these theories go back to the Chicago School, who developed the theory of invasion-succession to explain why neighborhoods change. Neighborhoods evolved to conform to the needs of one ethnic group. Competition over the use of space and other resources occurs after the entry, or "invasion," by another group and the exit, or "succession" of the incumbent group.[^black-belt]

[^black-belt]: It bears mentioning that the original Chicago School sociologists did not have such a developed theory for *racial* differences. They removed the "Black Belt" graphically and symbolically by creating a separate zone in the concentric ring model that they left unexplained. 

## Social Disorganization

Social disorganization theories built on this foundation and argued that racial integration destabilizes neighborhoods. Interested in explaining crime and deviance, social disorganization theorists developed the hypothesis that structural conditions that undermine cohesion present opportunities for deviance to emerge [@sampson_community_1989; @perkins_participation_1990]. Race, being such a strong social force in American society, undermined cohesion between racial groups, leading to increased deviance and lower satisfaction [c.f., @putnam_e_2007]. \needcite

Researchers have consistently found evidence that higher levels of diversity lead to lower levels of neighborhood satisfaction. The erosion of social cohesion further exacerbated interracial differences and contributed to white flight [@taub_paths_1984]. Research on patterns of change from the 1950s to the 1980s showed that that the entry of Black residents into white neighborhoods led whites to flee and the neighborhood to turnover rapidly [@duncan_negro_1957; @taeuber_negroes_1965; @bader_fragmented_2016]. Recent evidence also supports the hypothesis that racial diversity undermines social cohesion, lowers neighborhood satisfaction, and increases violence [@hipp_specifying_2009; @legewie_contested_2016; @green_defended_1998]. 

Robert Putnam argued that the United States was following a trend found throughout Western countries. Cultural differences between groups reduced the interpersonal bonds that neighbors felt, leading to fewer institutions that support social capital among locals. The disintegration of ties as racial or ethnic diversity increased, he argued, was consistent across racial and ethnic groups. 

## Uniqueness of White Aversions to Integration

Some evidence contradicts the assertions that racial integration universally decreases cohesion. In a review of the literature van der Meer and Tolsma -@van_der_meer_ethnic_2014 found that the association only existed in the US, and even then, was limited largely to white sentiments. Abascal and Baldassarri -@abascal_love_2015 found that the larger number of whites in multiracial neighborhoods and their lower satisfaction in those neighborhoods created the illusion that integration caused dissatisfaction. Instead, white antipathy toward integration acted as the mechanism to create dissatisfaction. 

Evidence that whites react differently to racial integration than other racial groups receives support from other two other literatures. The first literature derives from the defended neighborhood hypothesis [@suttles_social_1972]. The hypothesis derives from the idea that community members band together to defend their neighborhoods against outside threats. In the context of race relations throughout most of American history, the defense included guarding against non-white residents moving into neighborhoods [@sugrue_origins_1996] \needcite. Racialized perceptions of places led whites to perceive neighborhoods with fewer whites as less desirable and less safe than those with more whites \needcite[Swaroop; Quillian and Pager; Sampson and Raudenbush]. If the defenses failed, the most well-to-do whites would leave \needcite. The "limited liability" view of neighborhoods [@janowitz_community_1967] means that the most disgruntled whites would remain, frustrated by both their dissatisfaction with integration and indignation that wealthier whites were able to leave. Lower demand among metropolitan whites for homes in the neighborhood decreases home values and may further frustrate incumbent white residents \needcite[Harris; Korver-Glenn \& Howell].

Evidence for the uniqueness of white dissatisfaction also comes from research on racial residential preferences. This body of work shows a correlation between the white share of residents in neighborhoods and the percentage of whites who express a preference for those neighborhoods. Research has shown the strong influence of racial composition using a variety of methods including experimental designs, stated preferences for specific neighborhoods, and drawing ideal neighborhood compositions \needcite[Emerson; Krysan; Charles]. That whites also reveal these same preferences when moving further confirms the influence of whiter racial compositions on white preferences and satisfaction. People of color, in contrast, prefer neighborhoods with a wider diversity of residents. While they show some preference for own-race neighbors, the preferences are small compared to those expressed by whites. Among some subgroups, people of color show a greater preference and more satisfaction as the share of white neighbors increases \needcite[Greif; Bader and Krysan]. 

# Diversity as Collective Identity

A small but growing body of research studies find that multiracial neighborhoods develop cohesion around the notion of diversity. These studies do not base their research on the dual-race model of the Chicago School. Instead, they examine multiracial neighborhoods as a distinct type of racial integration. Lumley-Sapanksi and Fowler -@lumley-sapanski_planning_2017 showed residents of all races were satisfied living in a "hyperdiverse" neighborhood in Seattle. Groups compromised with one another, getting some, but not all, of what they desired in order to maintain neighborhood diversity. Similarly, Spitz -@spitz_segregated_2015 finds that neighborhood residents value diversity in a multiracial neighborhood in Milwaukee. In both cases, residents were willing to trade off their optimal neighborhood conditions to sustain racial diversity. This was true even if residents lacked strong interpersonal bonds that bridged racial groups. These more recent studies echo Maly's -@maly_beyond_2005 argument that collective identities develop around racial diversity in integrated neighborhoods that help different groups feel satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods [see also, @nyden_neighborhood_1998]. 

Recent studies of racial preferences show a growing appreciation for diverse neighborhoods among whites. In interviews of white parents in two different cities, Darrah-Okikie and colleagues found that parents valued diversity of their neighborhoods when searching for housing. Similarly, using survey data, Krysan and colleagues showed that multiracial neighborhoods were the most desired type of neighborhood across racial groups. The white participants in the study were, however, averse to living in neighborhoods integrated only with black or Latino residents [@bader_community_2015].

Finally, demographic analyses reveal a persistence of multiracial integration over several decades. Logan and Zhang identified neighborhoods based on a presence of Asian, Black, Latino, and white residents commensurate with their metropolitan composition. They termed those neighborhoods where all four groups were present "global neighborhoods" based on the common roots with the rise of "global cities" based on finance and international flows of trade \needcite[Sassen]. They estimated that 38 percent of neighborhoods in 2010 were global neighborhoods [@logan_global_2011]. Bader and Warkentien -@bader_fragmented_2016 used a model-based approach of classifying neighborhoods. They found that "quadrivial neighborhoods," those with stable or slow change in the percentage of Asian, Black, Latino, and white residents over four decades, made up between eight and twenty percent of neighborhoods in the metropolitan areas of the four largest US cities. 

# Satisfaction Living in Multiracial Neighborhoods

Satisfaction among residents of multiracial neighborhoods warrants greater study given the novelty of multiracial integration and its questionable fit with traditional theories of racial change. Long-term multiracial integration offers the possibility of improving race relations and pluralist orientations in American society. Those possibilities are unlikely to come to pass if residents of all races are not satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods. This article asks the question: *are residents of all races satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods?* 

Existing studies do not fully answer the question for one of three reasons. First, data come from periods when multiracial neighborhoods only just started emerging. For example, Hipp's -@hipp_specifying_2009 study, the most comprehensive study of neighborhood satisfaction in the US, used data as far back as 1987 to draw the conclusion that integration leads to dissatisfaction. The number of multiracial neighborhoods would have been exceedingly small and the neighborhoods were most likely unique. The second, related, problem arises from inductive studies of multiracial neighborhoods since they study specific neighborhoods, often ones that explicitly developed around the shared value of diversity. Finally, the stated preferences for diverse neighbors expressed by whites might be more aspirational than actual. Havekes and colleagues showed that whites tended to restrict their searches to whiter neighborhoods at every stage of the search. Even so, it leaves the question whether whites who end up living in multiracial neighborhoods due to moves by people of color find satisfaction in neighborhoods that integrate around them.

I analyze three dimensions of the question guided by propositions set forth in both more traditional studies of integration and those from more recent work on multiracial neighborhoods. I summarize the dimensions, research questions, and hypotheses in Table \ref{tab:theory}.

\input{../analysis/tables/theory.tex}

Comparative Satisfaction.

: The first question examines the comparison of satisfaction between residents of multiracial neighborhoods and residents elsewhere in the metropolitan area. The social disorganization theory (labeled "A" in Table \ref{tab:theory} predicts that residents of all racial groups will be less satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods than same-race counterparts are living in other types of neighborhoods. In comparison, Abascal and Baldassare predict that would only be the case among whites (labeled "B" in Table \ref{tab:theory}). Although not explicit in studies of multiracial integration, research suggests that residents of multiracial neighborhoods will be no different than residents elsewhere in the metropolitan area. 

Internal Satisfaction. 

: The second question makes comparisons *among* residents of multiracial neighborhoods and asks if any group is less satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods than other groups. Traditional theories predict that whites will be less satisfied than their neighbors of color. The unsuccessful defense of neighborhoods against racial incursion increases dissatisfaction among whites who remain in integrated neighborhoods. Ethnographies of multiracial neighborhoods, however, predict equal levels of satisfaction among residents of all racial groups. 

Perceptions of Neighborhood Change.

: The third question investigates how residents perceive changes in their neighborhood. While traditional theories appear not to fit the experiences of residents living in multiracial neighborhoods, they do provide a useful distinction between current satisfaction and perceptions of change. The negotiation and compromise necessary to sustain integration, or declining perceptions of neighborhood quality by outsiders, might wear on residents to the point of perceiving that their neighborhoods have, in fact, declined. Traditional theories predict that disgruntled whites unable to move out of the neighborhood as it integrated would remain and retain a very pessimistic perceptions of change. Theories based on multiracial neighborhoods would, in contrast, predict all residents, regardless of race, to have neutral to positive views about how the neighborhood has changed. 


# Data & Methods

I test these hypotheses using what I believe to be the first representative sample of residents living in multiracial neighborhoods in a large metropolitan area. After describing the samples upon which the analysis is based, I present the results that show some evidence that multiracial neighborhoods level neighborhood satisfaction, and then end by discussing the relevance of the findings for both theoretical development and practical policies. 

## Study Region
Data to test the hypotheses come from two samples of Washington, DC-area residents in 2016 and 2018. Washington, D.C. has historically been a segregated metropolitan area. Almost all Blacks lived in the eastern part of the city and nearly all whites in the western part. This east-west pattern spilled out to the Maryland suburbs. A few Blacks lived across the Potomac River in Northern Virginia, though they were highly clustered in a small number of neighborhoods. In 1980, Asians and Latinos each made up only 3 percent of the DC-area population.

The region's economy grew and became less based on the federal government in the 1980s and 1990s. The expansion of finance, insurance, and real estate services sector mirrored the sector's prominence in redeveloping metropolitan areas in the U.S. and abroad. Real estate developers capitalized on the expanding population by developing large swaths of land in middle-ring suburbs encircling the District. Having been built after the Fair Housing Act passed, the housing developed was not subject to the history of redlining and restrictive covenants. 

During the same period, the region emerged as an immigrant destination: by 2015 a quarter of residents were born outside of the United States, with the largest shares of foreign-born residents having come from El Salvador, India, and Korea. Latinos and Asians now comprise 16 and 11 percent of DC-area residents, respectively, while Blacks make up 29 percent and whites 41 percent of the population. As the nation's capital and importance in international relations, the region's foreign-born residents are more socioeconomically diverse than average. Among foreign-born residents ages 25 and older in the DC area, 21 percent have a bachelor's degree and 22 percent have a graduate degree, compared to 17 percent and 12 percent nationally. 

Residents of all races were attracted to these new suburban homes, especially in Montgomery and Fairfax Counties that boasted nationally renowned school systems. Additionally, Montgomery County has, since 1974, mandated that all housing developments larger than 20 units include a set percentage of units that qualify as affordable housing [@urban_institute_expanding_2012].[^fairfax] As Figure @fig:map shows, multiracial neighborhoods were especially likely to emerge along the hub-and-spoke system of the region's commuter rail lines in these counties [see also, @holloway_racially_2012].

![Map of sampled tracts in 2016 DC Area Survey](../analysis/images/DCASCommunityMap.png){#fig:map}

[^fairfax]: Fairfax County passed an inclusionary zoning ordinance in 1971, but it was struck down by the Virginia Supreme Court. Fairfax County implemented a different mandatory inclusionary zoning policy in 1990 [@silverstein_welcome_2017].

## Survey Samples

Both surveys represented residents in the Washington, DC area, which comprised Washington, D.C. and the surrounding jurisdictions of Montgomery and Prince George's Counties in Maryland, Arlington and Fairfax (including the cities of Falls Church and Fairfax) Counties Virginia, and the independent city of Alexandria, Virginia, an area that comprises **TK: Total Population** residents. The 2016 DC Area Survey represents residents of two types of neighborhoods: multiracial and disproportionately Latino. Analyses for this study only include responses from residents sampled in the multiracial neighborhoods. 

Multiracial neighborhoods included in the 2016 DCAS sampling frame met two criteria. First, neighborhoods comprised at least 10 percent Asian, Black, Latino, and white residents. This cutoff was used to ensure that each of the four racial groups represented a distinguishable subset of a neighborhood's residents. Second, none of those four groups could represent a majority of residents. This criterion was included to eliminate neighborhoods where a single group formed the dominant identity of the neighborhood.[^latino-enclaves] These criteria resulted in a sample frame of 114 neighborhoods that represented just under 585,000 people.[^one-criterion] The majority of neighborhoods were in Montgomery County, Maryland, followed by Fairfax County, Virginia, then Prince George's County, Maryland. The neighborhoods included in the sampling frame are shown in Figure @fig:map. An address-based sample of households was drawn from these eligible neighborhoods and included over-samples of households with Asian and Hispanic surnames and households located in from disproportionately Black tracts among those that still satisfied the criteria to be included as multiracial neighborhoods. Statistics describing the multiracial neighborhood sample of the 2016 DCAS data are reported in Table \ref{tab:descriptives16}.

[^latino-enclaves]: Disproportionately Latino neighborhoods were those in which Latino residents made up at least a quarter of the residents and were not already classified as a multiracial neighborhood.

[^one-criterion]: Eighteen neighborhoods met the first inclusion criterion but not the second. Of those eighteen, fifteen were neighborhoods that had a white majority; six were located in Fairfax County, Virginia (including one in Fairfax city), five in Montgomery County, Maryland, and two each in D.C. and Arlington County, Virginia. Two neighborhoods had a Black majority, one each in Montgomery County and Prince George's County, and only one neighborhood, in Montgomery County, had a Latino majority. 

\input{../analysis/tables/descriptives_dcas16.tex}

Table \ref{tab:nhddescriptives} contains a comparison of multiracial neighborhoods to all neighborhoods in the DC area. Whites make up about a third of multiracial neighborhoods, on average, while Latinos make up about a quarter. Blacks and Asians make up 22 and 18 percent of residents, respectively. Immigration represented the largest deviation of multiracial neighborhoods from DC-area neighborhoods overall. Immigrants make up two of every five residents in multiracial neighborhoods, compared to just under one of every four residents in neighborhoods overall. Residents of multiracial neighborhoods had slightly lower educational attainment than neighborhoods overall. One in four residents of multiracial neighborhoods, however, had a bachelor's degree and one in five had a post-graduate degree. Married households and those with children comprised a larger share of households in multiracial neighborhoods compared to DC area neighborhoods overall.

\input{../analysis/tables/nhood_descriptives.tex}

The 2018 DC Area Survey drew a sample representative of the *entire* DC area. The sample was stratified by jurisdiction to guarantee representation of all jurisdictions in the data.[^combined] The 2018 DCAS included over-samples of tracts with disproportionately large Black and Latino populations. Statistics describing the 2018 DCAS data are reported in Table \ref{tab:descriptives18}.

\input{../analysis/tables/descriptives_dcas18.tex}


[^combined]: Arlington County and the City of Alexandria were combined into a single stratum. 

## Dependent Variable

The analyses used a dichotomous measure of neighborhood satisfaction. Both surveys asked respondents, "How satisfied are you with your neighborhood as a place to live?," a question that has been used in previous research [see, e.g., @woldoff_effects_2002; @greif_intersection_2015]. Respondents who indicated that they were "extremely" or "very" satisfied living in their neighborhood were coded as being satisfied. Those who indicated that they were "somewhat" or "not at all" satisfied were coded as being unsatisfied.

## Independent Variable
A measure created from respondents' self-identified race and ethnicity was the independent variable in all analyses. I classified racial groups into four mutually exclusive categories based on the respondents' answers to questions about race (respondents were allowed to choose multiple racial groups) and Hispanic ethnicity. I classified those respondents who indicated Hispanic ethnicity as *Latino*, regardless of their race. Among the remaining non-Latino respondents, I classified as *white* those who selected white as their only race; as *Black* those identified as Black, either alone or in combination with any other race; and as *Asian* those who identified as Asian or Pacific Islander, either alone or in combination with any race other than Black. Respondents missing on either the race question or the ethnicity question and respondents who did not satisfy the criteria above were not included in the analysis. This left a final analytic dataset of **{N(2016)}** respondents in 2016 and **{N(2018)}** respondents in 2018.

## Control Variables
I included variables to control for other demographic characteristics of residents. I calculated *age* based on respondents' birth year and *gender* based on respondents' gender identity, for which they were given the choices "male," "female," and "other." Female was set as the reference. Only two respondents chose "other" and were coded as missing on this question. I included an indicator for *being partnered* based on those respondents who indicated that they were "now married or in a marriage-style arrangement," with those not currently partnered as the reference.

I included whether the respondent had *children in the household* because the presence of children could affect the outlook residents have of their neighborhoods. The question did not limit the response to respondents' own children. I also included an indicator to measure whether respondents were *foreign born* since immigrant status would likely correlate with residential perceptions and race simultaneously.

I represented socioeconomic status with a measure of *educational attainment*. I created a measure with five categories based on the highest level of education respondents reported: less than high school, high school (including GED), some college (including associates degrees), bachelors degree, and graduate degree. I chose to use educational attainment to measure socioeconomic status because it is a more stable measure than income, and space did not permit the DCAS to ascertain income longitudinally. Income also had more missing data (N=) compared to educational attainment (N=**{miinc}**). Among those respondents who answered both questions, however, education and income were highly correlated.

I also include measures of neighborhood experience that account for neighborhood lifecourse characteristics. First, I included the *years respondents lived in their neighborhoods* since the lifecourse model presumes that people will become accustomed to the norms and will become more satisfied as they live in the neighborhood over a longer period. Second, I included a measure of *neighborhood size*. This measure was self-reported by respondents and including it in models accounts for how subjective perceptions of neighborhood boundaries affect satisfaction and perceived change. Table \ref{tab:nhddescriptives} contains descriptive statistics of variables for the complete samples of the 2016 DCAS and the 2018 DCAS, as well as each survey by racial group.

## Analytical Approach

I used logistic regression analysis to test the hypotheses above. The general model is expressed in the equation:

$$
\mathbf{\eta} = \alpha + \mathbf{\beta^T X} + \mathbf{\gamma^T Z} + \mathbf{\delta_j}
$$

where $\mathbf{\eta}$ is the vector of outcomes for respondents transformed using a logistic link function. In the model, $\alpha$ measures the intercept, and $\mathbf{\beta}$ is a vector of point estimates for racial groups (with whites omitted). Non-Latino whites were the reference group since the hypotheses ask whether whites differ from other groups. The vector $\mathbf{\gamma}$ contains point estimates of demographic and neighborhood experience controls, $\mathbf{Z}$. 

Analyses based only on models of residents living in multiracial neighborhoods included a fixed effect, $\mathbf{\delta_j}$, for the neighborhood of residence. Neighborhoods were defined as residents' census tracts. The median neighborhood included five respondents and a maximum of twenty residents lived in neighborhood. Nine neighborhoods had only a single respondent. The nine respondents from these neighborhoods were dropped from the analysis. Including neighborhood fixed effects makes the estimates, $\mathbf{\beta}$, reflect the differences between white outcomes and those of Asians, Blacks, and Latinos *living in the same neighborhood*. 

All analyses were conducted in R (version 3.6.3), and they all accounted for missing data and the complex survey design. I used the `Amelia` package [@honaker_amelia_2011] to impute missing values in five datasets. I conducted all analyses using these five datasets weighting outcomes to account for the complex sample design using the `survey` library [@lumley_analysis_2004]. I combined all results using Rubin's [-@rubin_multiple_2004] rules. A replication package that includes all data and code used for the models is available at \[redacted\].

# Results

## Racial Variation Between Residents of Multiracial Neighborhoods and Other Metropolitan Residents

The analyses above provide sound evidence for the stability-based model of multiracial integration. The results leave open the possibility, however, that residents living in multiracial neighborhoods are less satisfied than other DC-area residents. To study this possibility, I compared models estimated using the multiracial sample from the 2016 DCAS to models estimated using the DC area-wide sample from the 2018 DCAS.  

Table \ref{tab:descbn} shows neighborhood satisfaction among residents of the DC area. Among residents of the entire DC area, 78.3 percent were satisfied in their neighborhoods. Consistent with the social disorganization hypothesis, this was 7.6 percentage points higher than satisfaction felt among residents of multiracial neighborhoods ($p{<}0.05$ from a two-sample t-test). But Table \ref{tab:descbn} also shows that the lower satisfaction levels could be largely attributed to white residents. White residents of multiracial neighborhoods were 16.2 percent less likely to be satisfied with their neighborhoods than white residents in the DC area ($p{<}0.001$). Asian residents of multiracial neighborhoods were also less likely to be satisfied than DC-area Asian residents, but the difference was insufficiently large to be confident that it did not arise from sampling error ($p{=}0.200$). Black and multiracial neighborhood residents were 2.1 percentage points less likely to be satisfied than Black DC-area residents generally, while Latinos were about equally likely to be satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods as elsewhere in the DC area. 

\input{../analysis/tables/between_descriptives.tex}

The pattern of lower satisfaction exclusively among whites held after controlling for other demographic and neighborhood characteristics. Figure @fig:between shows the predicted value of neighborhood satisfaction for different racial groups from separate models estimated for the multiracial neighborhood and the complete DC-area sample. I calculated the predicted value at the mean value of each control variable at the mean value of each variable in the metropolitan-wide (i.e., DCAS 2018) sample.[^MEM] The plot shows a clear difference in satisfaction between white multiracial neighborhood residents and white residents in the DC area, but only small differences for other groups. The share of Asian residents of multiracial neighborhoods satisfied in multiracial neighborhoods was only 3.5 percentage points lower than the share of satisfied DC-area Asian residents. Almost no difference existed between Black residents of multiracial neighborhoods and Black residents overall. Latino residents of multiracial neighborhoods were *more likely* to be satisfied than Latinos overall after controlling for individual characteristics. 

![Predicted probability of neighborhood satisfaction among residents of multiracial neighborhoods and the DC area](../analysis/images/predicted_between.png){#fig:between}

[^MEM]: **Do I need an explanation for why I use this value rather than the marginal effects? If so, should it go in the text or in a footnote?**

These results cast doubt on the universality of the social disorganization theory. Black and Latino residents of multiracial neighborhoods were equally or more satisfied than their counterparts elsewhere in the metropolitan area. Even among Asians, the difference between multiracial neighborhood residents and metropolitan residents generally was small after controlling for individual characteristics. Only among whites did living in a multiracial neighborhood predict lower levels of satisfaction. 

These results provide some support for the racial stratification theory. But, the support, like the support from perceptions of neighborhood change, was tepid. White satisfaction was indeed lower in multiracial neighborhoods. Rather than showing large gains in neighborhood satisfaction among people of color, however, rates of neighborhood satisfaction are generally the same. These results show that multiracial neighborhoods level rates of neighborhood satisfaction by bringing the level of neighborhood satisfaction expressed by whites in line with the rates of satisfaction expressed by other groups. 

## Interracial Variation of Satisfaction within Multiracial Neighborhoods
Within neighborhood variation helps discern the process of multiracial integration and the prospects for long-term, stable integration. Large interracial differences in satisfaction could increase the propensity of dissatisfied groups to move out and could increase racial tensions and neighborhood strife within the neighborhood. The racial stratification theories described in the introduction predict white in particular would be less satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods compared to their neighborhoods of color. That whites living in multiracial neighborhoods might have been those unable to flee increase the probability that white residents will be less satisfied than other residents. I use the 2016 DCAS sample of residents living in multiracial neighborhoods to measure interracial variation within multiracial neighborhoods. 

I found that little variation exists *within* multiracial neighborhoods, consistent with the multiracial satisfaction hypothesis and contrary to the predictions of the racial stratification model. Table \ref{tab:descwn} reports the percentage of residents who expressed satisfaction living in multiracial neighborhoods by racial group as well as differences among groups. The first column shows that a large majority of residents, 71.3 percent, were satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods. It further shows few differences by race. Latino residents had the largest deviation from the overall mean, but that deviation was only 3.7 percentage points. Furthermore, the largest difference between any two groups, Blacks and Latinos, was only 6.2 percentage points.  

\input{../analysis/tables/within_descriptives.tex}

Regression analyses further confirmed the lack of interracial variation in neighborhood satisfaction. Table \ref{tab:within} reports the results estimating three models. All three models included a fixed effect for the neighborhood (tract) of residence. As a reminder, all three models included a neighborhood (tract) fixed effect that allows the estimates to be interpreted as racial differences among residents living in the same neighborhood. 

\input{../analysis/tables/within.tex}

The first model included only race and the neighborhood fixed effects. The parameter estimates confirm that there are only minimal differences by race. The marginal effects and 95 percent confidence intervals of this model, expressed as percentages of each group predicted to report being satisfied, are shown in Figure @fig:within. The average marginal effect measuring the difference in the probability of being satisfied compared to white residents of multiracial neighborhoods was -0.8 percent for Asian residents, 5.3 percent for Black residents, and 3.1 percent for Latino residents. 

![Marginal effects of race on being satisfied in multiracial neighborhoods compared to white residents of multiracial neighborhoods](../analysis/images/marginal_effects_within.png){#fig:within}

Adjusting for other characteristics led to a small increase in interracial variation. The estimated average marginal effects measuring the difference in probability of being satisfied compared to whites in the full model (also plotted in Figure \ref{fig:within}) increased to 0.6 percent among Asian residents, 6.0 percent among Black residents, and 6.7 percent among Latino residents. 

The final row of Table \ref{tab:within} shows further evidence against interracial differences in neighborhood satisfaction among residents of multiracial neighborhoods. The last row reports the Akaike information criterion (AIC), a measure that balances a model’s parsimony with its goodness of fit to the data @akaike_new_1974. Lower values indicate better fit, and the results show that the data fit a model without race (reported in the third column) better than a model including race (reported in the second column). Wald-F statistics across all imputed datasets confirm that the data fit the model without race better than the model with race.

These findings provide evidence that residents of all races are equally satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods. White residents, among whom the racial stratification theories would predict to be dissatisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods, were just as satisfied as their neighbors of color. What is more, a large majority of all four racial groups, ranging from 68.3 to 75.1 percent, reported being satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods. The widespread level of satisfaction among all four racial groups provides support for the stability-based model of multiracial integration. 

## Racial Differences in Perceptions of Neighborhood Change

I tested the robustness of this finding by also analyzing racial variation in how residents of multiracial neighborhoods evaluated the changes that had occurred in their neighborhoods. The measure provides extra evidence to test whether groups who remain in multiracial neighborhoods do so despite believing that their neighborhoods have gotten worse. Again, the racial stratification theory of racial change predict that whites would be disgruntled remaining as neighborhoods changed. The survey asked for responses to the prompt, "Looking back over the past five years or so, would you say that your neighborhood has...," and allowed respondents to choose from five responses: become a much better (worse) place to live, become a somewhat better (worse) place to live, or stayed about the same. I recoded responses into three categories representing whether respondents reported their neighborhoods getting better, worse, or staying the same. Because this was one of the first questions asked on the survey, and because it came before any questions about the respondent's own race or racial attitudes, respondents were not primed to think about neighborhood changes in the context of racial change. 

Overall, 34.5 percent of all residents living in multiracial neighborhoods think that their neighborhoods improved over the previous five years. In contrast, only 11.5 percent of residents think that their neighborhoods got worse. Just over half, 54.0 percent think that the neighborhood stayed the same. Figure @fig:change plots the percentage residents, by race, that think that their neighborhoods have gotten better, gotten worse, or stayed the same. Black and Latino residents were as likely as white residents to report that multiracial neighborhoods have gotten worse, contrary to the theoretical expectation that whites would perceive neighborhood declines. White residents were, however, less likely to think that the neighborhood had improved: only 26.9 percent report who their neighborhoods while 60.4 percent who believed that the neighborhood had stayed the same. In comparison, 37.8 percent of Asian residents, 36.9 percent of Black residents, and 39.5 percent of Latino residents reported that their neighborhoods had improved.

Controls in a regression model did not account for white residents' lower propensity to perceive neighborhood improvement in multiracial neighborhoods. Table \ref{tab:change} reports estimates of a race-only model and a model with the complement of controls, including neighborhood fixed effects, predicting perceived neighborhood improvement. Racial differences diminished only slightly in the models that included controls, especially the differences between whites and both Blacks and Latinos. The average marginal effects of race on neighborhood improvement from the full model compared to white residents were 13.8 percent for Black residents ($p{=}0.006$), 14.4 percent for Latinos ($p{=}0.010$), and 10.5 percent for Asians ($p{=}0.033$). The data fit the model including race better than the model without race.[^multinomial]

[^multinomial]: A multinomial model supported the absence of racial variation in negative evaluations of neighborhood change. The results did not show significant effect of racial identity in evaluating the neighborhood as having improved, either. The multinomial models, however, have very large standard errors because the models included neighborhood fixed-effects for 112 neighborhoods in each of two outcomes. The results of the multinomial models are included in the supplement. 

White residents' lower propensity to perceive neighborhood improvement compared to their neighbors of color provides some evidence that whites might not be eager to experience integration. But this finding lends only modest support to the racial stratification theory. Whites were not more likely than their neighbors to perceive neighborhood *decline*. Instead, whites perceived a *stable* trajectory of neighborhood change. Perceptions of stability combined with the generally high satisfaction among whites reported in the first analysis provide further support for the stability-based model of racial integration. 

**Do I need to include description of control variables?** If so:

* In both sets of analyses, education attainment and neighborhood size were associated with the outcomes.

    * High school-educated residents were much more satisfied in multiracial neighborhoods than those with all other levels of education. Perceptions of improvement, however, were lower among those with more education.

    * Residents who perceive their neighborhoods to be larger were more satisfied with their neighborhoods and were more likely to perceive neighborhood improvement.




# Discussion

Multiracial neighborhoods have become a feature of many US metropolitan areas, and this study asked whether residents find satisfaction living in them. We examined this topic with, to my knowledge, the first representative sample of residents living in multiracial neighborhoods in a metropolitan area. We found that white residents of multiracial neighborhoods are less satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods compared to whites elsewhere in the DC area. Despite being less satisfied than other white residents in the metropolitan area, however, white residents living in multiracial neighborhoods expressed similar levels of satisfaction to their neighbors of color. In fact, I did not find evidence of any association between race and neighborhood satisfaction among residents living in multiracial neighborhoods. Just as importantly, whites living in multiracial neighborhoods were not dissatisfied with how the neighborhood changed. Most reported feeling that the neighborhood had stayed about the same, while Asians, Blacks, and Latinos were more likely to report that the neighborhood improved. 

## Multiracial Neighborhoods as Leveling Structures

The findings contribute to a growing literature on multiracial neighborhoods. It supports the consensus that multiracial integration differs from conflict based theoretical models of neighborhood change that derive from the invasion\slash succession human ecological model. Instead, residents of multiracial neighborhoods develop a sense of satisfaction equally shared by residents of all races. By using data from a sample of more than 100 multiracial neighborhoods across a metropolitan area, this studies show that the conclusion of shared satisfaction drawn from inductive studies can be generalized to residents of multiracial neighborhoods. 

I make another contribution to the growing literature by comparing satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods to satisfaction in neighborhoods more broadly. I obtained a sufficient sample size to compare by racial group because I sampled residents from multiracial neighborhoods. Satisfaction rates in multiracial neighborhoods were similar to residents in the DC-area for all groups except whites, lending credence to Abascal and Baldassarri's findings and contradicting Putnam's hypothesis of general dissatisfaction with multiracial integration. Yet, even among whites, only \TK percent reported that their multiracial neighborhoods had gotten worse. 

Taking these two conclusions together, multiracial neighborhoods might offer a structure that levels satisfaction rates across the population. It should be, perhaps, no surprise that white satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods is lower than whites generally if we acknowledge that opportunities accumulate in the predominantly white neighborhoods where most whites live. Living in multiracial neighborhoods does not impose an additional cost on whites. Instead, whites living in multiracial neighborhoods experience similar satisfaction to their neighbors, and, therefore similar satisfaction to people of color in the metropolitan area generally. And given that people of color express stronger desires for integrated neighborhoods than whites, it's also not surprising that they would be more likely to report improvement in multiracial neighborhoods. In sum, multiracial neighborhoods might promote neighborhood equality.

Future research should examine this leveling hypothesis further. Whether multiracial neighborhoods retain a multiracial composition over time depends on a complex interplay of social forces that create moves into and out of neighborhoods of different races [c.f., @krysan_cycle_2017]. If whites who move out of multiracial neighborhoods move into predominantly white neighborhoods, multiracial neighborhoods might not remain completely integrated--even if those whites do not move because of the neighborhood racial composition. Monitoring changes that occur in multiracial neighborhoods as they mature will be important to understanding the potential and process of integration. 

In addition, the hypothesis should be studied in other metropolitan areas. DC differs from other metropolitan areas in ways that might increase the chance of satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods. The DC area includes jurisdictions that originated inclusive zoning policies that contribute to racial integration. In addition, the DC area ranks at the top or among the top metropolitan areas for educational attainment among Blacks and Latinos, and tends to draw immigrants from across the economic spectrum. All of these factors may help residents of multiracial neighborhoods build bonds across race more easily.[^identification]

[^identification]: While these factors might limit the generalizability of findings from the DC area, they also helped isolate racial effects in the data since race does not correlate as strongly with educational attainment and immigration in the DC area as it does in other metropolitan areas. 

## Basis for Racial Equity Policy

Keeping the caveats above in mind, the growing body of literature showing interracial satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods could become the basis for policy experiments promoting racial equity. The belief that whites end up dissatisfied when living in integrated neighborhoods has stymied progress toward policies. The results of this study, in combination with the previous literature, should provide policymakers reasonable confidence that the majority of all racial groups find satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods and that they are all equally satisfied in those neighborhoods.

Policymakers may wish to start by affirmatively marketing multiracial neighborhoods. Policymakers may wish to promote existing multiracial neighborhoods in their jurisdictions. Knowledge about neighborhoods tends to differ by race [@krysan_racial_2009; @krysan_cycle_2017]. Although knowledge multiracial neighborhoods have not been studied directly (and should be addressed by future studies), a lack of knowledge about specific multiracial neighborhoods might prevent movers from searching in those neighborhoods. Affirmative marketing campaigns could also highlight the large share of satisfied residents in multiracial neighborhoods. Such appeals could help assuage concerns about moving to multiracial neighborhoods. The second component could be successful as a large share of people express a desire--at least in the abstract--to move to diverse neighborhoods, even white parents that have traditionally been the most reticent to move to integrated neighborhoods. 

At the same time, multiracial neighborhoods do not constitute a panacea. Racial integration requires trading off benefits and costs [@bell_silent_2005]. There are good reasons to support further racial integration, but integration itself does not represent an unalloyed good. People of color, and Blacks in particular, are already aware of the trade-offs and have been negotiating them for decades \needcite[Lacy, Lewis-McCoy, Lewis]. Integration promotes a sense of the "real world," but also exposes them to the incivilities and daily danger of racism [@lacy_blue-chip_2007]. Policies that promote racial integration should also attend to the inclusion and access of residents living in those spaces. 

# Conclusion

This article finds a large share of residents are satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods and, more importantly, that Asian, Black, Latino, and white residents express satisfaction in equal numbers. The study contributes to a growing literature on multiracial neighborhoods that shows patterns of integration unexpected by dominant human ecological theories of neighborhood change. It provides the first data representative of residents living in multiracial neighborhoods in a metropolitan area, and shows that multiracial neighborhoods might represent a leveling structure that promote racial neighborhood equity. Research and policymakers should examine multiracial neighborhoods in more depth to build theory and policy that explain patterns of race and space in 21st century US neighborhoods.
