Multiracial neighborhoods---those shared among Asian, black, Latinx, and white neighbors---have become common in U.S. metropolitan areas since the 1980s. @logan_global_2011 estimated that 38 percent of neighborhoods in 2010 were what they termed "global neighborhoods." Similarly, @bader_fragmented_2016 found stable multiracial integration, what they called "quadrivial neighborhoods," represented between eight and twenty percent of neighborhoods in the metropolitan areas of the four largest cities. That multiracial neighborhoods emerged to an appreciable number of neighborhoods from barely existing three decades ago reflects a change in the relationship between between race and metropolitan space. 

Empirically, however, racial integration has reduced levels of neighborhood satisfaction. Lower neighborhood satisfaction can decrease attachment residents feel to their neighbors and neighborhoods, reduce a sense of collective efficacy, and ultimately lead people to move out \needcite. The reason for lower satisfaction has been the subject of debate. Social disorganization theories posit that racial differences reduce social capital and trust that lead to lower satisfaction. These theories predict low levels of satisfaction among all racial groups living in multiracial neighborhoods. Racial stratification theories predict that white residents with resources will flee integrating neighborhoods, leaving the most disgruntled white residents in integrated neighborhoods. Finally, neighborhood lifecourse theories argue that neighborhood change leads to dissatisfaction, and heterogeneity acts as a proxy of this underlying change. 

All three groups of theories imply that racial integration creates dissatisfaction, destabilizes neighborhoods, and ultimately lead to neighborhood racial change. This paper presents evidence in favor of an alternative hypothesis: residents of all races feel sufficiently satisfied living in *multiracially* integrated neighborhoods to provide a basis for stable racial integration. I test this alternative hypothesis using data from a representative sample of residents living in multiracial neighborhoods in the Washington, DC area. I find that residents of all racial groups are similarly satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods. I further find that, compared to metropolitan residents overall, only whites show a lower level of neighborhood satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods.

# Neighborhood Satisfaction in Racially Integrated Neighborhoods

The existence of multiracial neighborhoods leads back to the progress won by the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. The Fair Housing Act outlawed discrimination in real estate. While its impact was neither immediate nor universal, the Act provided a legal mechanism to challenge blatant forms of racial discrimination. Immigration reform reflected another success of the Civil Rights Movement that increased increased the diversity of the American populace through immigration from Latin America and Asia. Finally, white attitudes toward blacks specifically and people of color generally have become more tolerant in the wake of the Civil Rights Movement. 

Despite the progress evident in the legacy of these laws and decreasing racial animosity, the US remains a segregated nation. Where integration has taken root, it has germinated in formerly all-white neighborhoods as people of color have moved in. While some neighborhoods subsequently transitioned to have no whites, many others remained racially integrated. *Multiracial* integration has been more likely to persist compared to neighborhoods shared among only two groups. 

## Change-Based Theories of Racial Integration

While the growing prevalence of multiracial neighborhoods would seem to presage a growing desire for integrated neighborhoods, research generally finds that racial integration is related to lower neighborhood satisfaction. Researchers have developed several theories to explain why racial integration diminishes neighborhood satisfaction. I sort the different theories into three classes below based on the similarities of mechanisms thought to affect neighborhood satisfaction. 

*Social disorganization theory* posits that multiracial integration itself undermines neighborhood social capital and attachment. Race forms such a strong basis for social solidarity that the mere presence of racial others undermines trust and attachment to neighbors. Putnam further argued that diversity diminishes social capital among *all* residents, and its influence would not limited to interracial relationships. Social disorganization theory implies that neighborhood satisfaction will be low across all racial groups within multiracial neighborhoods. 

In the most comprehensive study to date on the topic of residential satisfaction, Hipp -@hipp_specifying_2009 found that racial heterogeneity had a strong negative effect on satisfaction using American Housing Survey data from 1987 to 1999. Woldoff -@woldoff_effects_2002 also found that social disorganization lowered neighborhood attachment based on data from Nashville residents collected in 1988. Legewie and Schaeffer -@legewie_contested_2016 showed that complaints of minor incivilities reported to New York City's 311 service in the early 2010s, were higher in integrated neighborhoods because they represented contested boundaries. These studies indicate a general sense of declining neighborhood satisfaction among residents of integrated neighborhoods.

A second class of models focus on *racial stratification* to explain lower satisfaction. The defended neighborhoods hypothesis argues that existing residents establish and maintain neighborhood boundaries to exert control [@suttles_social_1972]. Incursion by people of color into all-white neighborhoods leads to violent responses or appeals to the municipal authorities to resolve disputes. If those efforts fail to stymie the influx of racial outsiders, those with the means to do so leave the neighborhood [@sugrue_origins_1996; @green_defended_1998]. This view of neighborhoods as communities of "limited liability" implies that the most disgruntled whites and those least satisfied with neighborhood changes, would remain in the neighborhood [@janowitz_community_1967]. This process also implies the stratification of neighborhoods as whites with resources leave, leading to lower housing demand, as people of color enter the neighborhood. 

In contrast to the social disorganization theory, racial stratification theories imply that incumbent residents will be less satisfied than incoming residents. Swaroop and Krysan -@swaroop_determinants_2011 found evidence that neighborhood satisfaction was lower among whites who lived in neighborhoods with fewer whites. Greif -@greif_intersection_2015 found that whites generally had the highest neighborhood satisfaction, and that black and Latino homeowners were especially sensitive to problematic social conditions. Studies of moves out of neighborhoods, an indirect measure of neighborhood dissatisfaction, find that whites are more likely to leave neighborhoods as the percentage of non-whites increases. The theories would expect that the whites left behind after the unsuccessful "defense" of racial boundaries would be especially dissatisfied in the neighborhood. Inversely, people of color are especially attracted to integrated neighborhoods while whites are not. Swaroop and Krysan -@swaroop_determinants_2011, for example, found *higher* neighborhood satisfaction among Latinos who lived in neighborhoods with fewer Latinos.

A final set of models focus on *neighborhood life course* to explain dissatisfaction. The systemic model proposed by Kasarda and Janowitz -@kasarda_community_1974 argues that residential turnover undermines neighborhood social capital. Lower satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods might be the result of those neighborhoods having experienced recent residential turnover, not due to racial differences *per se*. Life course theory would predict *higher* satisfaction among whites given their longer tenure in multiracial neighborhoods (which also implies that controlling for time in residence would negate racial differences). 

Minimal evidence supports the systemic factors of the neighborhood life course perspective. Some evidence exists that the racial composition of a neighborhood acts as a proxy or cognitive shortcut since racial composition correlates with neighborhood problems [e.g., @harris_why_2001]\needcite[Clark]. Notably, Kasarda and Janowitz \needcite based their conclusion on data from Great Britain. Despite arguing that they expected that their findings would "converge with those already encountered in the United States," their argument does not explain how. 

## Leveling 

Despite their differences, the three classes of theories above all imply that neighborhood change is fraught and expect tension between newcomers and incumbents. All three sets of models rely to varying degrees on the invasion\slash succession model of neighborhood change [@park_human_1936; @mckenzie_ecological_1984; @duncan_negro_1957; @taub_paths_1984]. Race exerts such a large influence over social life that racial differences between incumbents and newcomers exacerbate the proposed processes and cause inevitable tension. 

Evidence that racial change inherently destabilizes neighborhoods and leads to dissatisfaction and instability has been based on the specific historical context of race in the United States. The period of study, from the 1930s forward, were occurring in a period of explicit white animosity based in part on the fear among white ethnics of losing newfound racial status, suburban expansion that provided destinations where whites could flee, and political-economic power that had not yet shifted from the heavily unionized manufacturing sector of the Northeast and Midwest to service-sector economies on the coasts and across the Sunbelt [@sugrue_origins_1996; @jackson_crabgrass_1985; @boustan_was_2010]. In short, it's unclear whether the same conditions hold that link racial integration to neighborhood dissatisfaction and racial transition. 

Existing evidence already challenges the conclusion that integration leads to fraught neighbor relations, neighborhood dissatisfaction, and, ultimately, neighborhood racial transition. Lumley-Sapanksi and Fowler -@lumley-sapanski_planning_2017 showed residents of all races were satisfied living in a "hyperdiverse" neighborhood in Seattle. Groups compromised with one another, getting some, but not all, of what they desired in order to maintain neighborhood diversity. Similarly, Spitz -@spitz_segregated_2015 finds that neighborhood residents value diversity in a multiracial neighborhood in Milwaukee. In both cases, residents were willing to trade off their optimal neighborhood conditions to sustain racial diversity. This was true even if residents lacked strong interpersonal bonds that bridged racial groups. These more recent studies echo Maly's -@maly_beyond_2005 argument that collective identities develop around racial diversity in integrated neighborhoods that help different groups feel satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods [see also, @nyden_neighborhood_1998]. 

These qualitative studies reveal a meaningful shortcoming of dominant theories. Namely, that interracial integration initiates inevitable racial change because race imposes such a strong barrier to social cohesion. The qualitative studies offer an alternative theory that *multiracial* diversity offers a new collective identity that helps to maintain residential stability. Neighbors have similar levels of satisfaction regardless of racial group. A collective identity forged around neighborhood diversity is strong enough that residents forgo some desirable amenities to maintain that identity. Evidence suggests that this may even be true among white residents who, because of the historic inequity of metropolitan development, have more options to maximize neighborhood satisfaction in predominantly white communities.  

Two hypotheses arise from this recent evidence of neighborhood satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods:

Hypothesis 1:

: most residents of multiracial neighborhoods will be satisfied with their neighborhood, but satisfaction will be lower among residents of multiracial neighborhoods than residents of the metropolitan area as a whole

Hypothesis 2:

: residents of multiracial neighborhoods will have similar levels of neighborhood satisfaction regardless of race. 

I test these hypotheses using what I believe to be the first representative sample of residents living in multiracial neighborhoods in a large metropolitan area. After describing the samples upon which the analysis is based, I present the results that show some evidence that multiracial neighborhoods level neighborhood satisfaction, and then end by discussing the relevance of the findings for both theoretical development and practical policies. 


# Data & Methods

## Study Region
Data to test the hypotheses come from two samples of Washington, DC-area residents in 2016 and 2018. Washington, D.C. has historically been a segregated metropolitan area. Almost all blacks lived in the eastern part of the city and nearly all whites in the western part. This east-west pattern spilled out to the Maryland suburbs. A few blacks lived across the Potomac River in Northern Virginia, though they were highly clustered in a small number of neighborhoods. In 1980, Asians and Latinxs each made up only 3 percent of the DC-area population.

The region's economy grew and became less based on the federal government in the 1980s and 1990s. The expansion of finance, insurance, and real estate services sector mirrored the sector's prominence in redeveloping metropolitan areas in the U.S. and abroad. During the same period, the region emerged as an immigrant destination: by 2015 a quarter of residents were born outside of the United States, with the largest shares of foreign-born residents having come from El Salvador, India, and Korea. Latinos and Asians now comprise 16 and 11 percent of DC-area residents, respectively, while blacks make up 29 percent and whites 41 percent of the population. As the nation's capital and importance in international relations, the region's foreign-born residents are more socioeconomically diverse than average. Among foreign-born residents ages 25 and older in the DC area, 21 percent have a bachelor's degree and 22 percent have a graduate degree, compared to 17 percent and 12 percent nationally. 

Real estate developers capitalized on the expanding population by developing large swaths of land in middle-ring suburbs encircling the District. Having been built after the Fair Housing Act passed, the housing developed was not subject to the history of redlining and restrictive covenants. Residents of all races were attracted to these new suburban homes, especially in Montgomery and Fairfax Counties that boasted nationally renowned school systems. Additionally, Montgomery County has, since 1974, mandated that all housing developments larger than 20 units include a set percentage of units that qualify as affordable housing [@urban_institute_expanding_2012].[^fairfax] As Figure @fig:map shows, multiracial neighborhoods were especially likely to emerge along the hub-and-spoke system of the region's commuter rail lines in these counties [see also, @holloway_racially_2012].

![Map of sampled tracts in 2016 DC Area Survey](../analysis/images/DCASCommunityMap.png){#fig:map}

[^fairfax]: Fairfax County passed an inclusionary zoning ordinance in 1971, but it was struck down by the Virginia Supreme Court. Fairfax County implemented a different mandatory inclusionary zoning policy in 1990 [@silverstein_welcome_2017].

## Survey Samples

Both surveys represented residents in the Washington, DC area, which comprised Washington, D.C. and the surrounding jurisdictions of Montgomery and Prince George's Counties in Maryland, Arlington and Fairfax (including the cities of Falls Church and Fairfax) Counties Virginia, and the independent city of Alexandria, Virginia. The 2016 DC Area Survey sought to represent residents of two types of neighborhoods---multiracial and disproportionately Latinx---in the Washington, D.C. area, and analyses only include responses from residents sampled in the multiracial neighborhoods. The 2018 DC Area Survey drew a representative sample of the entire DC area, stratified by jurisdiction.[^combined]

[^combined]: Arlington County and the City of Alexandria were combined into a single stratum. 

Multiracial neighborhoods included in the 2016 DCAS sampling frame met two criteria. First, neighborhoods comprised at least 10 percent Asian, black, Latinx, and white residents. This cutoff was used to ensure that each of the four racial groups represented a distinguishable subset of a neighborhood's residents. Second, none of those four groups could represent a majority of residents. This criterion was included to eliminate neighborhoods where a single group formed the dominant identity of the neighborhood.[^latino-enclaves] These criteria resulted in a sample frame of 114 neighborhoods that represented just under 585,000 people.[^one-criterion] The majority of neighborhoods were in Montgomery County, Maryland, followed by Fairfax County, Virginia, then Prince George's County, Maryland. The neighborhoods included in the sampling frame are shown in Figure @fig:map. An address-based sample of households was drawn from these eligible neighborhoods and included over-samples of households with Asian and Hispanic surnames and households located in from disproportionately black tracts among those that still satisfied the criteria to be included as multiracial neighborhoods. The 2018 DCAS included over-samples of tracts with disproportionately large black and Latino populations. 

[^latino-enclaves]: Disproportionately Latinx neighborhoods were those in which Latinx residents made up at least a quarter of the residents and were not already classified as a multiracial neighborhood.

[^one-criterion]: Eighteen neighborhoods met the first inclusion criterion but not the second. Of those eighteen, fifteen were neighborhoods that had a white majority; six were located in Fairfax County, Virginia (including one in Fairfax city), five in Montgomery County, Maryland, and two each in D.C. and Arlington County, Virginia. Two neighborhoods had a black majority, one each in Montgomery County and Prince George's County, and only one neighborhood, in Montgomery County, had a Latinx majority. **MOVE TO APPENDIX?**

Table \ref{tab:nhddescriptives} contains a comparison of multiracial neighborhoods to all neighborhoods in the DC area. Whites make up about a third of multiracial neighborhoods, on average, while Latinxs make up about a quarter. Blacks and Asians make up 22 and 18 percent of residents, respectively. Immigration represented the largest deviation of multiracial neighborhoods from DC-area neighborhoods overall. Immigrants make up two of every five residents in multiracial neighborhoods, compared to just under one of every four residents in neighborhoods overall. Residents of multiracial neighborhoods had slightly lower educational attainment than neighborhoods overall. One in four residents of multiracial neighborhoods, however, had a bachelor's degree and one in five had a post-graduate degree. Married households and those with children comprised a larger share of households in multiracial neighborhoods compared to DC area neighborhoods overall.

## Dependent Variable

The analyses used a dichotomous measure of neighborhood satisfaction. Both surveys asked respondents, "How satisfied are you with your neighborhood as a place to live?," a question that has been used in previous research [see, e.g., @woldoff_effects_2002; @greif_intersection_2015]. To measure current neighborhood *satisfaction*, respondents who indicated that they were "extremely" or "very" satisfied living in their neighborhood were coded as being satisfied. Those who indicated that they were "somewhat" or "not at all" satisfied were coded as being unsatisfied.

## Independent Variable
A measure created from respondents' self-identified race and ethnicity was the independent variable in all analyses. I classified racial groups into four mutually exclusive categories based on the respondents' answers to questions about race (respondents were allowed to choose multiple racial groups) and Hispanic ethnicity. I classified those respondents who indicated Hispanic ethnicity as *Latinx*, regardless of their race. Among the remaining non-Latinx respondents, I classified as *white* those who selected white as their only race; as *black* those identified as black, either alone or in combination with any other race; and as *Asian* those who identified as Asian or Pacific Islander, either alone or in combination with any race other than black. Respondents missing on either the race question or the ethnicity question and respondents who did not satisfy the criteria above were not included in the analysis. This left a final analytic dataset of **{N(2016)}** respondents in 2016 and **{N(2018)}** respondents in 2018.

## Control Variables
I included variables to control for other demographic characteristics of residents. I calculated *age* based on respondents' birth year and *gender* based on respondents' gender identity, for which they were given the choices "male," "female," and "other." Female was set as the reference. Only two respondents chose "other" and were coded as missing on this question. I included an indicator for *being partnered* based on those respondents who indicated that they were "now married or in a marriage-style arrangement," with those not currently partnered as the reference.

I included whether the respondent had *children in the household* because the presence of children could affect the outlook residents have of their neighborhoods. The question did not limit the response to respondents' own children. I also included an indicator to measure whether respondents were *foreign born* since immigrant status would likely correlate with residential perceptions and race simultaneously.

I represented socioeconomic status with a measure of *educational attainment*. I created a measure with five categories based on the highest level of education respondents reported: less than high school, high school (including GED), some college (including associates degrees), bachelors degree, and graduate degree. I chose to use educational attainment to measure socioeconomic status because it is a more stable measure than income, and space did not permit the DCAS to ascertain income longitudinally. Income also had more missing data (N=) compared to educational attainment (N=**{miinc}**). Among those respondents who answered both questions, however, education and income were highly correlated.

I also include measures of neighborhood experience that account for neighborhood lifecourse characteristics. First, I included the *years respondents lived in their neighborhoods* since the lifecourse model presumes that people will become accustomed to the norms and will become more satisfied as they live in the neighborhood over a longer period. Second, I included a measure of *neighborhood size*. This measure was self-reported by respondents and including it in models accounts for how subjective perceptions of neighborhood boundaries affect satisfaction and perceived change. Table **{#tab:descriptives}** contains descriptive statistics of variables for the complete samples of the 2016 DCAS and the 2018 DCAS, as well as each survey by racial group.

## Analytical Approach

I used logistic regression analysis to test the hypotheses above. The general model is expressed in equation [\[eq:generalmodel\]](#eq:generalmodel){reference-type="ref" reference="eq:generalmodel"}:

$$\label{eq:generalmodel}
\mathbf{\eta} = \alpha + \mathbf{\beta^T X} + \mathbf{\gamma^T Z} + \mathbf{\delta_j}$$

where $\mathbf{\eta}$ is the vector of outcomes for respondents transformed using a logistic link function. In the model, $\alpha$ measures the intercept, and $\mathbf{\beta}$ is a vector of point estimates for racial groups (with whites omitted). Non-Latinx whites were the reference group since the hypotheses ask whether whites differ from other groups. The vector $\mathbf{\gamma}$ contains point estimates of demographic and neighborhood experience controls, $\mathbf{Z}$. I first estimated each outcome with only the intercept and race terms included. I then estimated each outcome with controls present. I conducted all analyses in R version **{Rversion}**.

All models included a fixed effect, $\mathbf{\delta_j}$, for the neighborhood of residence. Neighborhoods were defined as residents' census tracts. Including neighborhood fixed effects makes the estimates, $\mathbf{\beta}$, reflect the differences between white outcomes and those of Asians, blacks, and Latinxs *living in the same neighborhood*. The median neighborhood included five respondents and a maximum of twenty residents lived in neighborhood. Nine neighborhoods had only a single respondent. The nine respondents from these neighborhoods were dropped from the analysis. 

All analyses accounted for missing data and the complex survey design. I used the `Amelia` package [@honaker_amelia_2011] to impute missing values in five datasets. I conducted all analyses using these five datasets weighting outcomes to account for the complex sample design using the `survey` library. I combined all results using Rubin's [-@rubin_multiple_2004] rules. All data and code used for the models presented here are available at \[redacted\].

# Results

## Interracial Variation of Satisfaction within Multiracial Neighborhoods
Within neighborhood variation helps discern the process of multiracial integration and the prospects for long-term, stable integration. Large interracial differences in satisfaction could increase the propensity of dissatisfied groups to move out and could increase racial tensions and neighborhood strife within the neighborhood. The racial stratification theories described in the introduction predict white in particular would be less satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods compared to their neighborhoods of color. That whites living in multiracial neighborhoods might have been those unable to flee increase the probability that white residents will be less satisfied than other residents. I use the 2016 DCAS sample of residents living in multiracial neighborhoods to measure interracial variation within multiracial neighborhoods. 

I found that little variation exists *within* multiracial neighborhoods, contrary to the predictions of the racial stratification model. Table \ref{tab:descwn} reports the percentage of residents who expressed satisfaction living in multiracial neighborhoods by racial group as well as differences among groups. The first column shows that a large majority of residents, 71.3 percent, were satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods. It further shows few differences by race. Latino residents had the largest deviation from the overall mean, but that deviation was only 3.7 percentage points. Furthermore, the largest difference between any two groups was only 6.2 percent (between Latino and black residents).  

\input{../analysis/tables/within_descriptives.tex}

Regression analyses further confirmed the lack of interracial variation in neighborhood satisfaction. Table \ref{tab:within} reports the results estimating three models. All three models included a fixed effect for the neighborhood (tract) of residence. As a reminder, this allows the estimates to be interpreted as racial differences among residents living *in the same neighborhood*. 

\input{../analysis/tables/within.tex}

The first model included only race and the neighborhood fixed effects. The parameter estimates confirm that there are only minimal differences by race. The average marginal effect measuring the difference in the probability of being satisfied compared to white residents of multiracial neighborhoods was -0.8 percent for Asian residents, 5.3 percent for black residents, and 3.1 percent for Latino residents. The marginal effects and 95 percent confidence intervals of this model unadjusted for demographic and neighborhood characteristics are shown in Figure @fig:within.

![Marginal effects of race on being satisfied in multiracial neighborhoods compared to white residents of multiracial neighborhoods](../analysis/images/marginal_effects_within.png){#fig:within}

Adjusting for other characteristics increases interracial variation, but only by a very modest amount. The parameter estimates measuring the difference of Asian, black, and Latino residents from white residents all increased, as did the average marginal effects (also plotted in Figure \@ref{fig:within}). The estimated average marginal effect measuring the difference in probability of being satisfied compared to whites increased to 0.6 percent among Asian residents, 6.0 percent among black residents, and 6.7 percent among Latino residents. 

The final row of Table \ref{tab:within} shows further evidence against interracial differences in neighborhood satisfaction among residents of multiracial neighborhoods. The last row reports the Akaike information criterion (AIC), a measure that balances a model’s parsimony with its goodness of fit to the data @akaike_new_1974. Lower values indicate better fit, and the results show that the data fit a model without race (reported in the fourth column) better than a model including race (reported in the third column). Wald-F statistics across all imputed datasets confirm that the data fit the model without race better than the model with race.

These findings provide evidence that residents of all races are equally satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods. White residents, who the racial stratification theories would predict to be dissatisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods had similar were just as satisfied as their neighbors of color. The results instead reveal high levels of satisfaction shared equally among residents, and these levels of satisfaction could serve to maintain racial integration. 

## Racial Differences in Perceptions of Neighborhood Change

I tested the robustness of this finding by also analyzing racial variation in how residents of multiracial neighborhoods evaluated the changes that had occurred in their neighborhoods. The measure provides extra evidence to test whether groups, in particular whites who remain in place, do so despite believing that their neighborhoods have gotten worse. The survey asked for responses to the prompt, "Looking back over the past five years or so, would you say that your neighborhood has...," and allowed respondents to choose from five responses: become a much better (worse) place to live, become a somewhat better (worse) place to live, or stayed about the same. I recoded responses into three categories representing whether respondents reported their neighborhoods getting better, worse, or staying the same. Because this was one of the first questions asked on the survey, and because it came before any questions about the respondent's own race or racial attitudes, respondents were not primed to think about neighborhood changes in the context of racial change. 

Overall, 34.5 percent of all residents living in multiracial neighborhoods think that their neighborhoods improved over the previous five years. In contrast, only 11.5 percent of residents think that their neighborhoods got worse. Just over half, 54.0 percent think that the neighborhood stayed the same. 

Figure @fig:change plots the percentage residents, by race, that think that their neighborhoods have gotten better, gotten worse, or stayed the same. White residents were equally likely as black and Latino residents to report that multiracial neighborhoods have gotten worse, contrary to the theoretical expectation that whites would perceive neighborhood declines. White residents were, however, less likely to think that the neighborhood had improved: only 26.9 percent report who their neighborhoods while 60.4 percent who believed that the neighborhood had stayed the same. In comparison, 37.8 percent of Asian residents, 36.9 percent of black residents, and 39.5 percent of Latino residents reported that their neighborhoods had improved. 

![Percent of respondents who report how neighborhood has changed in past five years by race](../analysis/images/nhood_change.png){#fig:change}

The significant interracial variation persisted after controlling for other characteristics in a regression analysis. Table \ref{tab:change} reports estimates of a race-only model and a model with the complement of controls, including neighborhood fixed effects, predicting perceived neighborhood improvement. Racial differences diminished only slightly in the models that included controls, especially the differences between whites and both blacks and Latinos. The average marginal effects of race in comparison to white residents on neighborhood satisfaction from the full model were 13.8 percent for black residents ($p{=}0.006$), 14.4 percent for Latinos ($p{=}0.010$), and 10.5 percent for Asians ($p{=}0.033$). The data fit the model including race better than the model without race.[^multinomial]

\input{../analysis/tables/change.tex}

[^multinomial]: A multinomial model supported the absence of racial variation in negative evaluations of neighborhood change.

White residents' lower propensity to perceive neighborhood improvement compared to their neighbors of color provides some evidence that whites might be eager to experience integration. But this finding lends only modest support to the racial stratification theory. Whites were not more likely than their neighbors to perceive neighborhood decline. Instead, whites perceived a stable trajectory of neighborhood change. Perceptions of stability combined with the generally high satisfaction among whites reported in the first analysis reduce the probability that white residents move out of multiracial neighborhoods. 

**Do I need to include description of control variables?** If so:

* In both sets of analyses, education attainment and neighborhood size were associated with the outcomes.

    * High school-educated residents were much more satisfied in multiracial neighborhoods than those with all other levels of education. Perceptions of improvement, however, were lower among those with more education.

    * Residents who perceive their neighborhoods to be larger were more satisfied with their neighborhoods and were more likely to perceive neighborhood improvement.

## Racial Variation Between Residents of Multiracial Neighborhoods and Other Metropolitan Residents

The analyses above provide sound evidence for a small amount of interracial variation in the satisfaction expressed by residents of multiracial neighborhoods. The results leave open the possibility, however, that residents living in multiracial neighborhoods are less satisfied than other DC-area residents. To study this possibility, which is central to the social disorganization theory, I used data for a companion DC Area Survey conducted in 2018 among a representative sample of all residents residing in the DC area jurisdictions. The 2018 DCAS drew a sample of **TK** households stratified by jurisdiction and resulted in 989 respondents who reported being Asian, black, Latino, or white. **{TK: other methodological details}**. Table \ref{tab:descriptives18} reports the descriptive statistics of respondents in the 2018 DCAS. 

\input{../analysis/tables/descriptives_dcas18.tex}

Table \ref{tab:descbn} shows neighborhood satisfaction among residents of the DC area. Among residents of the entire DC area, 78.3 percent were satisfied in their neighborhoods. Consistent with the social disorganization hypothesis, this was 7.6 percentage points higher than satisfaction felt among residents of multiracial neighborhoods ($p<0.05$ from a two-sample t-test). 

\input{../analysis/tables/between_descriptives.tex}

Table \ref{tab:descbn} also shows that the lower satisfaction levels could be largely attributed to white residents. White residents of multiracial neighborhoods were 16.2 percent less likely to be satisfied with their neighborhoods than white residents in the DC area ($p{<}0.001$). Asian residents of multiracial neighborhoods were also less likely to be satisfied than DC-area Asian residents, but the difference was insufficiently large to be confident that it did not arise from sampling error ($p{=}0.200$). Black and multiracial neighborhood residents were 2.1 percentage points less likely to be satisfied than black DC-area residents generally, while Latinos were nearly equally likely to be satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods as elsewhere in the DC area. 

This pattern held after controlling for other demographic and neighborhood characteristics. Figure @fig:between shows the predicted value of neighborhood satisfaction for different racial groups from separate models estimated for the multiracial neighborhood and the complete DC-area sample. I calculated the predicted value at the mean value of each control variable at the mean value of each variable in the metropolitan-wide (i.e., DCAS 2018) sample.[^MEM] The plot shows a clear difference in satisfaction between white multiracial neighborhood residents and white residents in the DC area, but only small differences for other groups. The share of Asian residents of multiracial neighborhoods satisfied in multiracial neighborhoods was only 3.5 percentage points lower than the share of satisfied DC-area Asian residents. Almost no difference existed between black residents of multiracial neighborhoods and black residents overall. Latino residents of multiracial neighborhoods were *more likely* to be satisfied than Latinos overall after controlling for individual characteristics. 

![Predicted probability of neighborhood satisfaction among residents of multiracial neighborhoods and the DC area](../analysis/images/predicted_between.png){#fig:between}

[^MEM]: **Do I need an explanation for why I use this value rather than the marginal effects? If so, should it go in the text or in a footnote?**

These results cast doubt on the universality of the social disorganization theory. Black and Latino residents of multiracial neighborhoods were equally and more satisfied than their counterparts elsewhere in the metropolitan area. Even among Asians, the difference between multiracial neighborhood residents and metropolitan residents generally was small after controlling for individual characteristics. Only among whites did living in a multiracial neighborhood predict lower levels of satisfaction. 

These results provide some support for the racial stratification theory. But, the support---like the support from perceptions of neighborhood change---was tepid. Rather than showing large gains in neighborhood satisfaction among people of color, as place-based racial stratification models would predict, rates of neighborhood satisfaction are generally the same. These final results provide evidence that multiracial neighborhoods serve to level rates of neighborhood satisfaction by brining the level of neighborhood satisfaction expressed by whites in line with the rates of satisfaction expressed by other groups. 


# Discussion and Conclusion

The analyses above demonstrated that Asian, Black, Latino, and white residents all had high and, more importantly, equal levels of satisfaction living in multiracially integrated neighborhoods. White residents were less likely than other racial groups to perceive that multiracial neighborhoods had improved, but were also not more likely to say their neighborhoods had declined. The majority of white residents instead perceived stability in their neighborhood trajectory. 

Whites were also the only racial group for whom satisfaction was lower among residents of multiracial neighborhoods than residents of the Washington, DC area generally. This result undermines the universality of the social disorganization theory. Only white and, to a lesser degree, Asian residents of multiracial neighborhoods were less satisfied than same-race residents of the DC area in general. 

These two conclusions, that there is little internal racial variation in satisfaction and that multiracial integration is associated with lower satisfaction among whites, are consistent with other research on multiracial neighborhoods. This finding supports the qualitative evidence of stable multiracial integration that I described in the introduction, and confirms that widespread satisfaction among residents of multiracial neighborhoods. The representativeness of this study also demonstrates the same shared satisfaction among the largely suburban population of residents living in multiracial neighborhoods. 

These conclusions are also consistent with evidence from demographic analyses of neighborhood change. Decreasing levels of racial segregation are associated with people of color moving into predominantly white neighborhoods, such that few all-white neighborhoods now exist [@glaeser_end_2012; @friedman_declines_2008; @bader_fragmented_2016]. Logan and Zhang [-@logan_global_2010; -@logan_global_2011; @zhang_global_2016] have shown that whites tend to remain in neighborhoods that become multiracial neighborhood, especially if Asian and Latino residents move in first. The gradual increases in the number of non-white racial groups relative to whites is also consistent with the finding that whites might not sacrifice higher satisfaction to move *into* multiracial neighborhoods after considering the option [@darrah-okike_because_2020; @bader_fragmented_2016; @havekes_realizing_2016]. 

## Multiracial Neighborhoods as a Leveling Structure

It is unsurprising that white satisfaction would be lower in multiracial neighborhoods than in other communities. Due to the historical processes of metropolitan development has permitted whites to, intentionally or not, amass resources in predominantly white neighborhoods. Whites have been rarely forced to compromise on their wants and desires in these communities. The compromises that have been made in predominantly white neighborhoods have generally been made by people of color assimilating to the customs and norms of whiteness. 

Racial integration requires trading off benefits and costs. There are good reasons to support further racial integration, but integration itself does not represent an unalloyed good. People of color, and blacks in particular, are already aware of the trade-offs and have been negotiating them for decades. That black and Latino satisfaction among those living in multiracial neighborhoods compared to those living elsewhere reminds researchers to evaluate integration with the same critical perspective as residents do [@bell_silent_2005]. Integration promotes a sense of the "real world," but also exposes them to the daily incivilities and danger of racism [@lacy_blue-chip_2007]. 

When combined with previous qualitative research interpreting the process of integration, the evidence in this paper suggests that multiracial neighborhoods might serve to level inequality by making whites more aware of the racial integration's trade-offs. Racial integration and inclusion requires residents to compromise and to negotiate common understandings that are likely not as necessary for whites to do in predominantly white settings [@lumley-sapanski_planning_2017]. Yet recent research shows a growing preference among whites to consider multiracial neighborhoods for many of the same reasons that black parents have long cited [@darrah-okike_because_2020; @krysan_diversity_2017]. 

Of course, the trade offs are different and reflect continued racial stratification of American places. White residents evaluate multiracial neighborhoods against predominantly white areas while black residents, and other people of color, are often choosing between multiracial neighborhoods and those with fewer economic resources due to past and present spatial inequality. But policies and programs that support multiracial diversity might increase the probability or the necessity that white residents consider the trade-offs more seriously. 

## The Possibility of Stable Multiracial Neighborhoods

Future studies of racial integration should do more to observe the integration occurring in different kinds of neighborhoods, including in US suburbs. Multiracial integration occurs more commonly in suburbs than in central cities. With few exceptions (\needcite[Rastogi, Douds]), studies have focused on multiracial neighborhoods within central cities or in older suburbs. Neighborhood satisfaction might be especially likely in multiracial neighborhoods in the DC area because of much higher levels of educational attainment among groups of color, a long history of inclusionary zoning, and a large percentage of growth occurring after the 1960s. Whether equal levels of satisfaction with multiracial neighborhoods occur when some or all of these elements are missing is an important theoretical and practical question. 

Examining what variation exists in the features and attributes of neighborhoods residents find desirable provide another avenue for future research. The relatively small within-neighborhood sample sizes of the 2016 DCAS were not sufficient to investigate the sources of within-neighborhood variation. Clustered survey designs would facilitate studies of internal variation. Future studies might consider clustered designs with larger within-neighborhood sample sizes even if it means sacrificing the number of sampled neighborhoods.

This paper argues demonstrated that the conditions exist for stable multiracial integration across a representative sample of multiracial neighborhoods. The findings support the proposition that the large share of residents satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods---and the unanimity of satisfaction across racial groups---can maintain racial integration. Consistent with existing evidence, these findings underscore the necessity of developing and testing theories of neighborhood racial change that fit with contemporary conditions.
