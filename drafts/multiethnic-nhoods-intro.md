Multiracial neighborhoods---those shared among Asian, black, Latinx, and white neighbors---have become common in U.S. metropolitan areas since the 1980s. @logan_global_2011 estimated that 38 percent of neighborhoods in 2010 were what they termed "global neighborhoods." Similarly, @bader_fragmented_2016 found stable multiracial integration, what they called "quadrivial neighborhoods," represented between eight and twenty percent of neighborhoods in the metropolitan areas of the four largest cities. That multiracial neighborhoods emerged from barely existing three decades ago to being an appreciable number of metropolitan neighborhoods reflects changes to the relationship between between race and metropolitan space. The presence of multiracially integrated neighborhoods seemingly indicate progress toward equity. 

Empirically, however, racial integration has reduced levels of neighborhood satisfaction. The reason for lower satisfaction has been the subject of debate. Social disorganization theories posit that racial differences reduce social capital and trust that lead to lower satisfaction. These theories predict low levels of satisfaction among all racial groups living in multiracial neighborhoods. Racial stratification theories predict that white residents with resources will flee integrating neighborhoods, leaving the most disgruntled white residents in integrated neighborhoods. For many people of color, however, integrated neighborhoods represent an improvement over disadvantaged neighborhoods into which they have been steered by historical and ongoing segregation. Finally, neighborhood lifecourse theories argue that neighborhood change leads to dissatisfaction, and heterogeneity acts as a proxy of this underlying change. 

The three theories predict racial differences in satisfaction within multiracial neighborhoods, yet empirical tests of the theories have focused only on differences between neighborhoods. As a result, studies have not measured how much neighborhood satisfaction among current residents of multiracial neighborhoods depends varies by race. This paper remedies this oversight by assessing the level of satisfaction among a representative sample of residents living in multiracial neighborhoods in the Washington, DC area, and by comparing the responses to a representative sample of the all residents Washington, DC area. 

I make the argument in this paper that multiracial neighborhoods level-out racial disparities in neighborhood satisfaction. White residents of multiracial neighborhoods tend to be less satisfied than whites generally; inversely, Asian **[CHECK]**, black, and Latino residents of multiracial neighborhoods are more satisfied than their counterparts generally. In contrast to the expectation of social disorganization theory, however, satisfaction is relatively high and approximately equal to neighborhood satisfaction in the metropolitan area as a whole. Put simply, multiracial neighborhoods equalize racial disparities evident elsewhere in the metropolitan area. 

This leveling hypothesis is consistent with recent qualitative research on multiracial neighborhoods. These studies find a general satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods that comes about because residents of different racial groups compromise on desired neighborhood qualities rather than attempt to optimize race-specific preferences. **[GENERAL STATEMENT OF IMPORTANCE HERE]**

# Neighborhood Satisfaction in Racially Integrated Neighborhoods

## Theoretical Approaches

Research in the United States consistently finds evidence of lower satisfaction among residents living in integrated neighborhoods. Researchers have devised several theories to explain why racial integration diminishes neighborhood satisfaction. Each theory implies a set of mechanisms that create differences between neighborhoods as well as differences across residents within neighborhoods. 

*Social disorganization theory* posits that multiracial integration itself undermines neighborhood social capital and attachment. Race forms such a strong basis for social solidarity that the mere presence of racial others undermines trust and attachment to neighbors. Putnam further argued that diversity diminishes social capital among *all* residents, and its influence would not limited to interracial relationships. Social disorganization theory implies that neighborhood satisfaction will be low across all racial groups within multiracial neighborhoods. 

A group of other models focus on *racial stratification* to explain lower satisfaction. These models are grounded in Park and Burgess' invasion/succession model of human ecology. The defended neighborhoods hypothesis argues that existing residents establish and maintain neighborhood boundaries to exert control. Incursion by people of color into all-white neighborhoods leads to violent responses or appeals to the municipal authorities to resolve disputes. If those efforts fail to stymie the influx of racial outsiders, those with the means to do so leave the neighborhood. This view of neighborhoods as communities of "limited liability" implies that the most disgruntled whites and those least satisfied with neighborhood changes, would remain in the neighborhood. This process also implies the stratification of neighborhoods as whites with resources leave, leading to lower housing demand, as people of color enter the neighborhood. 

In contrast to the social disorganization theory, racial stratification theories imply that incumbent residents will be less satisfied than incoming residents. Whites, who are nearly always the incumbents in multiracial neighborhoods, would be less satisfied than their neighbors of color since multiracial neighborhoods almost exclusively emerged from neighborhoods that were overwhelming white. The theories would expect that the whites left behind after the unsuccessful "defense" of racial boundaries would be especially dissatisfied in the neighborhood. Inversely, people of color are especially attracted to integrated neighborhoods while whites are not. Residents of color might become even more satisfied with neighborhoods as diversity increases while white residents become less satisfied.  

A final set of models focus on *neighborhood life course* to explain dissatisfaction. The systemic model proposed by Kasarda and Janowitz argues that residential turnover undermines neighborhood social capital. Multiracial neighborhoods might be the result of those neighborhoods having experienced recent residential turnover, not due to racial differences *per se*. Qualitative evidence suggests that residents are satisfied living in neighborhoods with a long history of integration and identity as diverse neighborhoods. Residents have built strong relationships in these neighborhoods, even if they are not always interracial relationships, that increase their neighborhood attachment. Life course theory would predict *higher* satisfaction among whites given their longer tenure in multiracial neighborhoods (which also implies that controlling for time in residence would negate racial differences). The theory would not predict racial differences in assessments of neighborhood change, but would predict a strong positive relationship between length of residence and assessments of change. 

## Empirical Findings of Neighborhood Satisfaction in Multiracial Neighborhoods

The theories above imply both differences in satisfaction between neighborhoods and differences in satisfaction within neighborhoods. To date, however, research on multiracial neighborhoods has focused almost exclusively on the former. That research has generally found lower levels of satisfaction in racially integrated neighborhoods than neighborhoods with other types of racial composition.

Social disorganization theory has received substantial support as the source of lower satisfaction in integrated neighborhoods. Hipp, in the most comprehensive study to date on the topic of residential satisfaction, found strong evidence in favor of social disorganization theory. He found that racial heterogeneity had a strong negative effect on satisfaction that was independent of the additional strong negative effect that perceptions of crime. Woldoff similarly found that social disorganization lowered neighborhood attachment. She found that black residents were more attached to their neighborhoods even though they evaluated them lower than comparable white residents. Legewie and Schaeffer found integrated neighborhoods tended to have higher incidences of complaints for minor incivilities. These studies indicate a general sense of declining neighborhood satisfaction among residents of integrated neighborhoods. These findings lead to the hypotheses that:

Social disorganization hypothesis 1:

: white, black, Latino, and Asian residents of multiracial neighborhoods will be less satisfied than their counterparts of the same race living elsewhere

Social disorganization hypothesis 2:

: white, black, Latino, and Asian residents of will all have similarly low levels of satisfaction 

Racial stratification theory has also received support. Swaroop and Krysan found evidence that neighborhood satisfaction was lower among whites who lived in neighborhoods with fewer whites. In contrast, however, satisfaction was much *higher* among Latinos who lived in neighborhoods with fewer Latinos, and that race had little influence on black residents. Greif found that whites generally had the highest neighborhood satisfaction, and that black and Latino homeowners were especially sensitive to problematic social conditions. Studies of moves out of neighborhoods, an indirect measure of neighborhood dissatisfaction, find that whites are more likely to leave neighborhoods as the percentage of non-whites increases. These studies point to a declining satisfaction among whites experiencing integration, and a sensitivity of black and Latino residents to the negative neighborhood consequences associated with segregation. These studies provide a sense of how residents of the same race perceive neighborhoods with differing levels of integration, but do not measure differences by satisfaction among residents of different races who make up multiracial neighborhoods. 

Racial stratification hypothesis 1a:

: white residents of multiracial neighborhoods will be less satisfied than their white counterparts living elsewhere

Racial stratification hypothesis 1b: 

: black, Latino, and Asian residents of multiracial neighborhoods will be more satisfied than counterparts of the same race living elsewhere

Racial stratification Hypothesis 2:

: white residents of multiracial neighborhoods will be less satisfied than their black, Latino, and Asian neighbors

Minimal evidence supports the systemic factors of the neighborhood life course perspective. Some evidence exists that the racial composition of a neighborhood acts as a proxy or cognitive shortcut since racial composition correlates with neighborhood problems. Notably, Kasarda and Janowitz who developed the theory of these systemic factors, did so based on data from Great Britain. Although they claim that the findings would "converge with those already encountered in the United States," they do not explain how accounting for race would vary their findings. 

Neighborhood life course hypothesis:

: there will be no racial differences within or between neighborhoods after controlling for length of residence, housing tenure, and other aspects of neighborhoods

## Leveling 

Qualitative studies have examined the internal dynamics of multiracial neighborhoods. Lumley-Sapanksi and Fowler find a general satisfaction in a "hyperdiverse" neighborhood in Seattle. Residents have little internal consensus over what they want so that every group seems to get some, but not all, of what they want. Similarly, Spitz finds that neighborhood residents value diversity in a multiracial neighborhood, but racial groups tend to participate in racially homogenous activities. Maly has argued that a collective identity developed around racial diversity can help different groups feel satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods. Given the interpretive nature of these studies, however, they were not designed to represent statistically the population of residents. 

These qualitative studies suggest that multiracial neighborhoods help "level" satisfaction among groups. Whites are generally more satisfied with their neighborhoods than blacks and Latinos, in large part because historical segregation created more desirable conditions in predominantly white neighborhoods. Some amenities that make white neighborhoods the most desirable might be missing from multiracial neighborhoods. But those amenities are less frequently found in predominantly black or predominantly Latino neighborhoods. Leveling suggests that the racial stratification hypotheses 1a and 1b would hold, but that all racial groups would have similar---but high---levels of satisfaction. That is, in multiracial neighborhoods:

Leveling hypothesis:

: white, black, Latino, and Asian residents of multiracial neighborhoods will all have similarly high levels of satisfaction 


# Notes

Legewie and Schaeffer provide a synthesis of these two perspectives in their *contested boundary hypothesis*. They argue that ambiguity of racial boundaries increases social disorganization. The theory has not been tested on multiracial integration specifically. The novelty of multiracial neighborhoods suggest ambiguous social norms consistent with the contested boundaries hypothesis that would lead to disorganization and lower attachment to the neighborhood among residents.



#. Studying satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods can improve our theories of race and place. Three theories:
    #. Systemic Theory
    #. Place stratification
    #. Contested boundaries hypothesis (constrict claim)

#. All three theories describe differences *between* neighborhoods, but all have implications for differences *within* neighborhoods. Multiracial neighborhoods offer good test. Also stability will depend on the extent to which all groups are satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods.
    #. Systemic theory would predict that whites have higher satisfaction than people of color since they have lived in the neighborhood the longest; people of color will come to like the neighborhood more as they assimilate
    #. Contested boundaries suggests that racial groups will have similar, but low levels of satisfaction given that social disorganization will likely be higher in multiracial neighborhoods
    #. Place stratification theory would predicts that whites will have lower level of satisfaction relative to people of color because they were unable to move

#. Miscellaneous

    #. Including fixed effects will increase standard errors around the point estimates. Accordingly, the association between race and satisfaction must be measured by its influence on model fit, not based exclusively on whether individual coefficients reach statistical significance. 


    #. We must judge the relevance of race on satisfaction based on whether it improves the model fit, not only by statistical significance of specific coefficients. 


#. Practical Relevance: The analysis carries practical implications beyond the theoretical intervention.
