#. Multiracial neighborhoods are a novel type of neighborhood. We don't know much about satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods.

Multiracial neighborhoods---those shared among Asian, black, Latinx, and white neighbors---have become common in U.S. metropolitan areas since the 1980s. Logan and Zhang estimated that 38 percent of neighborhoods in 2010 were what they termed "global neighborhoods." Similarly, Bader and Warkentien found stable multiracial integration, what they called "quadrivial neighborhoods," represented between eight and twenty percent of neighborhoods in the metropolitan areas of the four largest cities. 

That multiracial neighborhoods emerged from barely existing three decades ago to being an appreciable number of metropolitan neighborhoods reflects changes to the relationship between between race and metropolitan space. Integrated neighborhoods seemingly indicates progress toward equity. The devastating consequences of racial segregation are well known, so its possible that these integrated spaces offer opportunities to overcome systemic inequality. Multiracial neighborhoods have, however, received little scholarly attention, especially compared to the attention devoted to the racial dynamics of gentrification and, more recently, "ethnoburbs." But only a smattering of studies have examined the experiences of residents living in multiracial neighborhoods.

Political victories from the Civil Rights Movement in fair housing and immigration reform made multiracial integration possible. Meanwhile, white Americans have became more racially tolerant. 

Two legal successes of the Civil Rights Movement, fair housing laws and immigration reform, reduced legal barriers to integration and paved the way for a more diverse populace. Growing numbers of immigrants from Latin America and Asia unsettled the stark black-white divide in many metropolitan areas. Growing populations stimulated housing construction, especially in "new immigrant destinations," that was governed by the anti-discrimination policies of the Fair Housing Act. Meanwhile, white Americans became more racially tolerant over the same period. Support for interracial marriage, for example, increased by 80 points from 1958 to 2013. While the trend might include those providing socially desirable answers, the idea that tolerant responses are now socially desirable represents progress from the 1970s when outward expressions of racist sentiments were far from taboo even if they had become unpopular.



# Residents' Satisfaction in Racially Integrated Neighborhoods

Research in the United States consistently finds evidence of lower satisfaction among residents living in integrated neighborhoods. Researchers have devised several theories to explain why racial integration diminishes neighborhood satisfaction. Each theory implies a set of mechanisms that create differences between neighborhoods as well as differences across residents within neighborhoods. 

*Social disorganization theory* posits that multiracial integration itself undermines neighborhood social capital and attachment. Race forms such a strong basis for social solidarity that the mere presence of racial others undermines trust and attachment to neighbors. Putnam further argued that diversity diminishes social capital among *all* residents, and its influence would not limited to interracial relationships. Social disorganization theory implies that neighborhood satisfaction will be low across all racial groups within multiracial neighborhoods. 

A group of other models focus on *racial stratification* to explain lower satisfaction. These models are grounded in Park and Burgess' invasion/succession model of human ecology. The defended neighborhoods hypothesis argues that existing residents establish and maintain neighborhood boundaries to exert control. Incursion by people of color into all-white neighborhoods leads to violent responses or appeals to the municipal authorities to resolve disputes. If those efforts fail to stymie the influx of racial outsiders, those with the means to do so leave the neighborhood. This view of neighborhoods as communities of "limited liability" implies that the most disgruntled whites and those least satisfied with neighborhood changes, would remain in the neighborhood. This process also implies the stratification of neighborhoods as whites with resources leave, leading to lower housing demand, as people of color enter the neighborhood. 

In contrast to the social disorganization theory, racial stratification theories imply that incumbent residents will be less satisfied than incoming residents. Whites in multiracial neighborhoods would be less satisfied than their neighbors of color since multiracial neighborhoods almost exclusively emerged from neighborhoods that were overwhelming white. The theories would expect that the whites left behind after the unsuccessful "defense" of racial boundaries would be especially dissatisfied in the neighborhood. Inversely, people of color are especially attracted to integrated neighborhoods while whites are not. Residents of color might become even more satisfied with neighborhoods as diversity increases while white residents become less satisfied.  

A final set of models focus on *neighborhood life course* to explain dissatisfaction. The systemic model proposed by Kasarda and Janowitz argues that residential turnover undermines neighborhood social capital. Multiracial neighborhoods might be the result of those neighborhoods having experienced recent residential turnover, not due to racial differences *per se*. Qualitative evidence suggests that residents are satisfied living in neighborhoods with a long history of integration and identity as diverse neighborhoods. Residents have built strong relationships in these neighborhoods, even if they are not always interracial relationships, that increase their neighborhood attachment. Life course theory would predict *higher* satisfaction among whites given their longer tenure in multiracial neighborhoods (which also implies that controlling for time in residence would negate racial differences). The theory would not predict racial differences in assessments of neighborhood change, but would predict a strong positive relationship between length of residence and assessments of change. 



In the most comprehensive study to date, Hipp studied many of these competing theories in a national sample of neighborhoods in US metropolitan areas. He found the strongest support for social disorganization theory. Individual perceptions of neighborhood physical and social disorder diminished neighborhood satisfaction, and neighborhood racial heterogeneity had a strong negative effect on neighborhood satisfaction. 


All three theories describe differences *between* neighborhoods, but all have implications for differences *within* neighborhoods.













Legewie and Schaeffer provide a synthesis of these two perspectives in their *contested boundary hypothesis*. They argue that ambiguity of racial boundaries increases social disorganization. The theory has not been tested on multiracial integration specifically. The novelty of multiracial neighborhoods suggest ambiguous social norms consistent with the contested boundaries hypothesis that would lead to disorganization and lower attachment to the neighborhood among residents.

#. Studying satisfaction in multiracial neighborhoods can improve our theories of race and place. Three theories:
    #. Systemic Theory
    #. Place stratification
    #. Contested boundaries hypothesis (constrict claim)

#. All three theories describe differences *between* neighborhoods, but all have implications for differences *within* neighborhoods. Multiracial neighborhoods offer good test. Also stability will depend on the extent to which all groups are satisfied living in multiracial neighborhoods.
    #. Systemic theory would predict that whites have higher satisfaction than people of color since they have lived in the neighborhood the longest; people of color will come to like the neighborhood more as they assimilate
    #. Contested boundaries suggests that racial groups will have similar, but low levels of satisfaction given that social disorganization will likely be higher in multiracial neighborhoods
    #. Place stratification theory would predicts that whites will have lower level of satisfaction relative to people of color because they were unable to move

#. Miscellaneous

    #. Including fixed effects will increase standard errors around the point estimates. Accordingly, the association between race and satisfaction must be measured by its influence on model fit, not based exclusively on whether individual coefficients reach statistical significance. 


    #. We must judge the relevance of race on satisfaction based on whether it improves the model fit, not only by statistical significance of specific coefficients. 


#. Practical Relevance: The analysis carries practical implications beyond the theoretical intervention.
